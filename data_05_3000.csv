The introduction was quite interesting, explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times, like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still, it was well worth a look-see.",1,1,0.7288135590000001,0.7288135590000001,NY

4,4,"I've been an occasional reader of the Wall Street Journal for many years, but had never really considered subscribing to it. For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.",1,1,0.578772803,0.578772803,NY
5,5,"I read nearly all my books and magazines on Kindle.  I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.  All things considered, the product is a good one - but the price extracted for buying it thru Amazon is too high.  I suppose I'll have to change my email -",1,0,0.625344353,0.0,NY
6,6,"Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.",1,1,0.631775701,0.7167505390000001,NY

18,18,"This authorized 2-volume set (joined into one fabulous ebook) from Random House/Bantam contains ALL the Sherlock Holmes novels and ALL the collections of Sherlock Holmes short stories, including ALL the stories in ""The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes"" frequently omitted from some other so-called ""complete"" sets; this set truly is 100% complete. EVERYTHING Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Sherlock Holmes is here: all 4 novels and all 56 short stories. The informative introduction by Loren D. Estleman is an added bonus (though it appears twice in this ebook version, once at the start of each of the 2 volumes as originally published in paperback by Bantam). This ebook edition is very well-formatted, comfortable to read, has an active TOC (in which the short stories are presented in proper order), and even accurately depicts the graphic representations in ""The Dancing Men,"" unlike many other versions which substitute the word ""graphics"" for the drawings. This is undoubtedly the very best Sherlock Holmes collection currently available in the Kindle Store. (The non-Holmes set of 10 ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is sometimes added to incomplete Holmes sets to boost their story total. There is no need for this complete Sherlock Holmes set to do so, but if you want it, ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is easily obtained separately as a public domain freebie in the Kindle Store.) So if you love reading these beloved classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries, this is THE ebook edition to purchase--and paying only $2.99 for Bantam quality (rather than going with some incomplete, unauthorized, no-name, ebook bundler) is a very good deal.ADDENDUM: Since the above was written Maplewood Books has come out with a now updated and truly complete edition of its own at 1/3 the price of this Bantam version.

29,29,"Magical, Mystical, Sensual . . . Enjoyable! While definitely all about the sex, this story brings a clear plot and a well-thought world in which our heroes and heroine have the pleasure of interacting. Perhaps I should say heroes and heroines . . . as the dragons are most certainly a major player in the plot of the story.There is never any inter-species hanky panky occurring, but the plot outlines a world where the dragon and its rider are so connected that both the dragon and rider are able to share feelings - including the sexual urges and desire that occur when the dragon is coupling with its mate. Of course, those feelings are intense, and of course they last for a very long time. (Dragons may be able to keep it in check for a very long time, but when they let loose . . . one should apparently be ready for almost anything!)The shared feelings and a lack of available females leads to an openness within the community around sex, and while there is no voyeurism involved, interaction may not be entirely behind closed doors . . . especially during a wedding! The lack of females also leads to an accepted practice of knights sharing mates - which is the case in this particular story. While there are sexual interactions between Gareth and Belara only, once Belara and her mother are brought back to the lair, that quickly changes, and Lars is added to the mix.There is an attempt made to slowly introduce the reader to multiple partners and all of the sexual exploits that situation can bring about. But, truly, there is lots and lots of sex in many different ways, shapes and forms. Outside of the sex, the plot does continue, and there is an epic battle scene described, and Belara's mother encounters the healing powers of a dragon. It's after this battle that Belara finds her dragon healing powers, and further cements her place within the community.A brief note: I was not especially happy with the ending of this story. It is a ""happily for now"", but it does set itself up to lead directly into a new book . . . a continuation of the story. Although not labeled as part of a series, the front cover lists the story as ""Dragon Knights"" - leading me to believe we will encounter this dragon community again, if not these particular characters again. That isn't a bad thing.A nice combination of fantasy and sex, this book is a nice one to pick up and lose yourself in! Enjoy!Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews",1,1,0.589322382,0.794661191,NY

35,35,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora.

37,37,"My Favorite of the series.  It is the story of Esme Canville and St John Radwell.  St John was the villain in the first book of the series, The Inconvenient Duchess.  In the years since the last novel, St John has transformed himself and is in the process of making himself into a respectable person.  Esme, however, is looking for the villain.  In order to avoid the arranged marriage her father has planned for her, Esme seeks St john to compromise her.  St John, however, delivers her to his brother (with whom he continues to have a strained relationship).  As could be expected, however, Esme and St John become involved in a relationship.I enjoyed this book because of the character of St john.  I really disliked him in the first book and almost stopped reading the book because of him.  However, he has completely redeemed himself and I was deeply interested in how he has remade himself but still has to deal with his past.  His care and consideration of Esme despite his temptation demonstrates how his character has changed.The book is a lighter read and is not overly complicated or intense, but I enjoyed it and recommend it.",1,1,0.587443946,1.0,NY

I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry.

46,46,"I don't mind when authors write a back story, but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond, when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring, and very repetitious, if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through, and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book?

47,47,"The book started of good.  About 25% into the book I started to skim because it was so repetative. The h gets picked on, then she gets picked on some more, afterwards she gets picked on again. Ok, h and H finally start a relationship at almost half way through the book and so I am back to paying attention.  ***SPOILERS*** The H cheats on the h with her nemisis, then tells her off because he is mad at her. Fast forward years later, she comes back to town and the H wants to win her back. What does he do? He attempts to make her jealous by making out with the same girl that he cheated on her with in front of her. He then pretends to go out with her in hopes that this will drive the h back to his arms.  Maybe it was just me but that has to be one of the most illogical things I have ever heard.  It is a stupid idea to do it with any girl but to do it with the SAME girl that he cheated with, that is just moronic.  I could have dealt with how slow the story was in the middle, I could have even gotten over the many  romance cliches in the book.  But, the H attempt to woo the h by making out with the OW in front of the h just ruined the book for me.

48,48,"Burroughs' Barsoom novels were among the first science fantasy books I read as a child long ago. In fact, I still have all eleven volumes in their original Ballantine Books paperbacks stashed in a box, along with numerous works by Heinlein, Clarke, Asimov, and others from the 1960's and 70's that I can't stand the idea of giving up. At least I know I can read them digitally when I want to. Too bad the entire series isn't part of this set.Burroughs' writing style would be considered comically stereotyped and hackneyed by modern standards, but the themes of chivalry, bravery, and respect for others are timeless - even though they might be considered out of style by modern standards. Some ideas are worth preserving, and IMO these types of stories do that very well.I grew up with these types of stories. I want to make sure my grandson can, too.",1,1,0.668604651,0.692275747,NY

50,50,"Author Steve Peek has managed to straddle two worlds, bring his characters through the veils that separate them and still maintain a shroud of mystery around his tale, Longclaws. Are they from the realm we refer to as Hell? Are they behind the legends of the vampire? Are they going to cause me to sleep with the lights on for a while?Longclaws are predators with super-human strength, speed and bravery in their world, where survival is a constant battle. Each member of the clan has an important role to play, vital to their survival, yet, we do not meet them as individuals because that seems unimportant, they are what and who they are, able to see the big picture in the battle for survival, fiercely loyal to their clan and their traditions. When one Leader finds a way to cross the veils that surround their world from ours, it is to survive. Humans are unknown demons to them, weak, yet with the will to survive that is respected by the longclaws. If not for their passing through these veils or ley lines a young boy would never know how to belong to a family, how to feel loved, or how to find self-respect. I wondered if there was a villain in this tale. I saw factions fighting for survival in the only way they knew how!Steve Peek's writing style is almost dreamlike, blending Indian folklore, ley lines, myths and legends into a tale that will stay with you, in a hauntingly beautiful way. He grounds his tale with humanity at its finest, everyday people coping with the impossible, often mirroring the clan's will for survival, but who will win in the end?On a personal note, I absolutely loved the writing, the plot, the characters, the style, the pace and the world-building....my anticipated nightmares, not so much.",1,1,0.569014085,0.461267606,NY

52,52,"At first glance, I almost dismissed Longclaws as a seen-it-before monster novel, derivative of that 1980's horror that filled my bookshelves long ago.  I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.  I can only hope that he has a few more tales to dust off and put out there, because I want to see what else lurks in the darkness of his brain.",1,1,0.5841584160000001,0.5841584160000001,NY

The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted, but it DOES have photographs.

75,75,"What we have here is a very interesting free Kindle download.  ""Babylonian Laws,"" which most of us were (I am not sure if this is still the case) exposed to in Junior High, or at the very latest, in High School, are of course more popularly known as ""The Code of Hammurabi"" and are the oldest known (I stress ""known"") laws we presently have access to.This copy, which was published in or around 1903 by C.H.W. Johns (1857 - 1920) contains all the know elements of this code.  Some of the material here is rather fragmented and much has been lost down through the ages.  After all, this work was created around B.C. 2285 - 2242.In this particular work we are given a very nice forward by C.H.W. Johns who was an Assyriologist and Church of England Clergyman.  Johns has quite a number of academic papers under his belt, this being one of them.After the introduction the actual code, or what we know if it, is recorded in all of its known sections.  I personally found this to be an interesting read.  I must admit to having never read the Code in its entirety before and this gave me a golden opportunity to do so.The reader will find that almost all aspects of society at that time were covered.  Quite a number of the situations found during those times no longer exists, but on the other hand many do and for me it is interesting to note that mankind has not changed all that much down through the ages.It is of particular note the various punishments required for infractions of many of these laws.  I covered the first 15 or so pages and I fear to tell you that had I lived at that time my life would have been rather short due to the fact that the death penalty seemed to be the main form of punishment...with drowning and burning being at the top of the list as to methodology.These laws, while quite primitive in our eyes, covered trade, marriage,  slave ownership, concubine management, farming, trade, social interaction and on and on.This is not a good forum to discuss all of these laws item by item as a large number of volumes have been published down through the years addressing this code and most have easy access to these works - if of course, there is interest.For those that are familiar with our current laws (those that possess a far greater understanding than I care to have) will be fascinated as to how this Code has influenced the laws of various societies down through the years.This, as I said, is a free down load and it is a most worthwhile download.  This is a part of our history ergo, we all need to be at least somewhat familiar with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",1,1,0.531548757,0.531548757,NY
76,76,"Up until the point where the author wrote that the Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church did nothing to help the Jews, the story was engrossing. However, the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries. Hundreds of priests went to the death camps for speaking out against Hitler.I, a Jewish woman, gave this book one star because of this major flaw.",1,0,0.575,0.13076923099999999,NY
77,77,"I was born not long after the end of World War II.  Some of my earliest memories are of hiding under the table out on my Grandma's porch listening to my Dad and all of my uncles talk about their experiences during the war.  World War II, and in particular the Holocaust, has always held a fascination (for want of a better word) for me. I've read countless books on the subject, watched dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours of movies and documentaries, and even had a chance to see & hear about some of what happened first hand both here at home and living in Germany.In general, I do not approve of fiction when it comes to the Holocaust.  Let me tell you why.  This is an event that must never be forgotten, an event that some (all too many) deny ever happened, even with many survivors and combatants on both sides still alive. So, when I hear about something like ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", first presented as a real event, then later declared to be a complete fiction by the authors themselves, I cringe.  It will not be long before all of the direct witnesses have passed.  Even my generation, the ones who heard the stories first hand, who saw the tattoos, who have walked the remnants of the battlegrounds, are getting on up there. Before too long, there will be nothing to witness except words written in a book.  Those words must be truth, not fantasy.  Otherwise, in 25 or 30 or 40 years people can simply point to a stack of made up books and say ""see - all fiction - never happened.""There are some cases, though, where a story is important to tell even if it must be told through the medium of fiction because there are no longer living witnesses - or perhaps never were.  One of those stories is the roundup,subsequent abandonment and final shipment to Auschwitz of more than 4,000 children in the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris, an action carried out by the French police on Petain's orders.  There were few survivors - a mere handful - and most of those were young children at the time.  Tatiana de Rosney does an excellent job of telling the story of this horrific event inSarah's Key.Until very recently even the fact that there WERE Jewish partisans was not particularly well known, at least not in popular mediums.  Leon Uris talks about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inExodus.  Rudi Weiss joins the Jewish partisans inHolocaust.  Only in the last few years has the story of the Bielski Brothers -The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 JewsandDefiance- truly documented the Jewish Resistance.  As heroic as the Bielskis were, their group was not the only Jewish resistance group. It is vitally important that a couple of decades from now, when all who were there to witness or spoke to those who witnessed are gone, that people know that everyone did not march quietly to the slaughter like so many sheep, that the Bielskis were neither alone in their resistance nor an aberration. There is room in the historical record forThe Remnant - Stories of the Jewish Resistance in WWII.Othniel Seiden's story has its foundations in a great deal of research - interviews, records of the Nuremberg proceedings, diaries left behind by those who lived these events - and he has done a remarkable job of presenting characters that are accurate & compelling composites.Some have commented negatively on his portrayal of the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Hitler's Final Solution, particularly as regards the Pope in office at the time of World War II, a role that has been the subject of great debate over the years, debate that is not yet entirely settled.  The basic facts that Seiden addresses in this regard - that the Catholic Church had a pact with Hitler and that the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Europe at the end of World War II - are grounded in known, demonstrable facts.  It is only since the papacy of Pope John Paul II, himself a Polish seminary student during World War II, that there has been some attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of Pope Pius XII regarding his actions towards the Nazis and the ""Final Solution."" Had Seiden chosen to present this rehabilitative material, information that would have been unknown to the characters at the time during which these events occurred, would be to rewrite history.  That would be a grave error.Highly recommended.  This is worth your time to read.",1,1,0.5932792579999999,0.694959443,NY
78,78,"Having an intense interest in the Holocaust for most of my adult life, this book was an easy choice when it popped up on my Kindle. I expect to feel disgust, anger and sadness when reading accounts of the Holocaust-what I didn't expect was how this book made me examine myself, and analyze what I believe in my heart...I am struggling to put into words what I am feeling, but I will try...Sol makes the point when talking to the priest that Christians have been taught from birth that the only way is through Christ, and they are all anti-Semitic, even if sub-consciously... I consider myself a Christian, but was not raised in any particular ""religion""- as a result, I only have the Bible to go on, where it is repeatedly said that the Jews are Gods Chosen people... I can't imagine that has changed. God is not fickle. Is God going to refuse the Jewish people, who also love and serve Him? If I thought that were possible than maybe He isn't a God I want to serve...As long as anyone is condemning someone else for having a different belief system than their own, we are doomed to repeat history. There are many paths to God. It makes me cringe when any one religion claims theirs' is the ONLY way. We need to embrace each other, as equal children of God, and remember that the Greatest Commandment is LOVE. Who are we to judge another?I highly recommend this book. It is a story of incredible courage and perseverance... it will definately make you think!",1,1,0.5816993460000001,0.535221496,NY
79,79,"The Remnants: Stories of the Jewish Resistance.By Othneil J. SeidenI loved this book! I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades. What should have been a day or two read, turned into almost a week because I had to keep stopping and looking things up; I have over two pages of notes on events and people and rumors that I had to chase down. And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it. There wouldn't be roses and birds singing all through the story line, but they were there when it was most unexpected. A great tale very carefully and thoroughly researched and plotted out.

He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE, you are MARRIED, you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating.

83,83,"This book was just ok. I was really looking forward to reading this one because it was a different take on the menage story. Instead of coming in on the part of the couple's story when their relationship was just starting we come in on the middle where it's on the verge of ending.I'm beginning to wonder if maybe I expect too much from my taboo or erotic reads.  For a romance I expect likable characters for the leads, characters that even if I don't agree with what they do that at the least I'll understand why. Both of those factors were missing in this book.  Logan the alpha male in the threesome was all alpha and not at all likable.  Usually I am the first one to jump up and root for an alpha male, but in this case there were very few redeemable qualities to be found in Logan.  As a reader you understand Catherine loves him, but why?  Rhys was better than Logan in that at least he was likable, but that was it.  There was nothing wonderful about him.To me the story would have been better if Catherine had stuck to her resolve even once,  made them really work for something. It just seemed that at every turn Catherine was giving in and going along with what they wanted.  In the end I found myself  just skimming the last few chapters. I'd recommend skipping this one.Stats:Ebook pages: 118 of actually storyGenre:  erotic, menage romanceRe-Readablitiy: NoneSteam Factor: Hot",1,0,0.5516014229999999,-0.203817535,NY

I found myself scanning more than reading because I couldn't deal with the overly flowery writing style.  If that type of writing is not your style, you will want to skip these books.

Survivors band into safe communities and evolve their own rules.  When a shape-shifting wolf/man is cast out of his tribe, he struggles to survive alone.  Mason finds sanctuary in an ocean cove and slowly builds new relationships with another shape-shifter dolphin/woman and a boy suffering from radiation poisoning.  Mason learns more about his own skills and his role in saving his people from a future catastrophe.  His lover cannot leave the ocean but Mason must make the arduous journey back to his tribe and deliver an important message.The author's beautiful prose and imaginative storyline brings this tale to life.  She makes the reader understand how a wolf hunts and see an underwater world.  The story may be filled with ""magical beings"" but it's set in our own future.  It's not the typical werewolf story, nor is it entirely a bleak Mad Max type of world.  There is hope and redemption for people who can learn to adapt and accept love and kindness.I searched out a novel featuring wolves and I was delighted with this novel.

109,109,"""Damaged Goods"" is the second book that I've read and reviewed by this talented author. The first one is not part of this series, therefore, this is my first exposure to the main character, Hannibal Jones. He is what appears to be a really ""neat"" guy. He is a private investigator who knows how to get to the bottom of any problem that comes his way. Jones is extremely capable and efficient as he sniffs out a crime in order to bring about some kind of justice in his own unique way. In this fictional novel, Jones remains unintimidated by some heavy duty, mob connected individuals...and refuses to cower in the presence of some very descriptive crime scenes. He also appears to be a man with a conscience which further endears him to me. His main squeeze is successful lawyer, Cindy Santiago, whose presence spices up the plot with their little romance.Author Austin Camacho manages to adeptly spin a suspenseful yarn as he entices his reading audience to be drawn right into the storyline. He certainly had my attention right from the get go. I not only enjoyed the main character, Hannibal Jones, but also his supporting cast of individuals who add to the thrill of this mystery.

In fact, the author drew all the threads together in a smooth, professional manner that impressed me.Toward the end, I admit to thinking *now* what's going to happen?

113,113,"Second in the Dragon Knights series, which is a different take on dragonriders; it resembles Anne McCaffrey's Pern books but is definitely for adult readers. The story starts with Lord Darian of Skithdron bedding a woman in a palace in order to gain access to secrets. He then decides that Lord Venerai and his ruler King Lucan are both deranged and evil.Two neighouring kingdoms, Draconia and Skithdron, are at odds and while the former boasts dragons as native beings, the latter has venomous serpentine beasts called skiths. These usually solitary creatures are being controlled for use in warfare by King Lucan. Adora, a healer woman, has just been seriously wounded by skiths and saved by a dragon, and now she is resting in the BORDER LAIR while her injuries heal. An older dragon knight called Jared, bonded to a female dragon called Kelzy, is caring for her and gradually falling for the courageous woman. Prince Nico of Draconia arrives and discerns that Adora is likely to be of lost royal blood, as she can 'hear' dragon speech and magically heal others.Belora, daughter of Adora, is also working as a healer, and mated to two dragon knights - women being scarce, the men willingly share a partner. Warfare is now waged openly between the kingdoms, the dragons flaming the skiths, which spit back acidic venom, while diamond-tipped crossbow bolts capable of piercing dragon scales are suddenly brought into use by the Skithdrons. Darius, fearing that the evil magic he has witnessed is taking over King Lucan, decides to defect in order to warn Draconia, thereby putting himself into grave peril. Meanwhile Adora is the subject of a well-meaning conspiracy by the dragon Kelzy, who decides that the woman requires two dragon knight mates.This is part of a complex series but can be read as a standalone, with sympathetic characters and well-imagined medieval warfare. Be warned, it features threesomes in a loving relationship between three life partners. Bianca D'Arc has written several books in this and her other fantasy series.

114,114,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBORDER LAIR is the second book in the Dragon Knights series. While I do believe that this book is strong as a standalone, Adora and Jared are introduced in MAIDEN FLIGHT and their romance really stems from there. This book takes on a different approach than the first book. I thought D'Arc really changed the tone of the series with this one. Things are far more bigger in this book - war is approaching and dark times are ahead.Unfortunately for Jared, his life has been in constant darkness since his wife and child died. His grief still lingers within him and he feels unworthy of Adora's love even though she is willing to give it freely. He deems himself undeserving and I think readers will be touched by Jared's gentle heart. Adora gentle coxes Jared out of his shell and slowly learns his ways. As their romance continues to bloom D'Arc really cements the fact that they are meant to be together, a third member is introduced. Lord Darian comes to warn them that death and destruction come their way and though he is seen as a traitor now, Jared welcomes his old friend. Darian takes an immediate interest in Adora and sparks fly between the two. However, as Darian is a member of the royal line of black dragons, Adora is aware that she cannot have something permanent with Darian even though she desperately wants to.D'Arc experiments with the mating rules and rituals she introduced in the first book and I liked seeing the happy ending at the end, but felt that the solution to the conflict seemed to happen too conveniently. I also felt that the romance was slightly impeded by Jared's hesitancy and seemed to fast-track too quickly after when he made the decision to be with Adora to make up for the time lost. Nevertheless, I was enraptured by D'Arc's world. Bringing together dragons, war and love, D'Arc is readily able to transport readers to another time, giving them an escape that they will sure to remember.The se x scenes, again, are very explicit but are well-done. D'Arc explores light bondage and m&eacute;na ge well and am always looking forward to seeing how she will bring three different people together for the purpose of love. She seems to do a stellar job each time.*ARC provided by publisher",1,1,0.615384615,0.7633136090000001,NY
115,115,"This is one of the top 5 Harlequin Presents books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of them. I think the best part of this book is that it is presented in a new way.It doesn't have the normal plot of jealous ex's or false pregnancy claims on the hero. This book shows how far a family is will to go to follow traditions and what they feel is in the best interest of their family even at the expense of hurting those involved in the deception. It shows how much Luc is willing to give because he regretted his past choices of those he believed wouldn't do him wrong. I loved how Skye wasn't selfish and realized how much Luc was sacrificing, even though he told her he didn't care. It shows how much she truly loves him. She took the initiative to try and correct past wrongs even though they were against her. It takes a lot of courage and love to do what she did.

Gabriella and Drummond were in love twenty-five years earlier, when an unbelievable act of betrayal--which had me in tears--rips the young lovers apart.  Gabriella ends up married to Lord St. John, heir to an Earldom, and Drummond--who at the time was a second son of a Duke--embarks on a career as a spy for the crown.Now, twenty-five years later, Gabriella finds herself in the mortifying position of being publicly sold by her husband!  When Drummond learns about the ""wife sale"" he is determined to have Gabriella as his own...he's never forgotten his first love.  However, once he secures possession of Gabriella he is determined to strip her of her ladylike inhibitions--Drummond refuses to be trapped in another passionless marriage.  In his endeavor to release Gabriella from the chains of ""proper"" society, Drummond assumes the role of Dom, and demands that Gabriella submit to his will (FYI, I would not classify this as a BDSM romance, although it does include a mild aspect of BDSM.)  Gabriella, not privy to Drummond's thoughts has no idea of his hidden agenda.  She just thinks he's an autocratic male, who is intent on humiliating her further.

Because of this, nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively ""hard"" sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology, but includes legal drama, detailed and appealing alien description, and good character depiction.

143,143,"REVISED 05-06-13: My initial inclination was to rate this set 4 or 5 stars until I realized it TOTALLY and consistently ignored Austen's use of italics in all her major works. Where Austen italicized a word for emphasis, this Bedford edition doesn't do so. Nor does it use all caps to equal italics, nor even before-and-after underlines (_like this_) the way some other editions do. When this was priced at only a dollar, some readers might have been willing to overlook this defect (if they were even aware of it), but now that the price has doubled to $1.99 (the same price as 2 superior editions in the Kindle Store), one shouldn't have to. I consider this a serious enough flaw to rate this Bedford edition only 2 stars (and as a fan of Jane Austen, I was sorely tempted to even rate it one lower).Some readers of this review may wonder why I consider this worthy of criticism. I do because Austen (whose wonderful works rate 5+ stars) was a true wordsmith; she meant precisely what she wrote and the manner in which she wrote it. The words she chose to emphasize contribute to the way she intended her stories to be read and understood. Since she is not excessive in her use of italics, when she does so it is significant to the precise nuance or witticism she is trying to put across. That's why it IS a big deal. Without italics, something of Austen is lost. Reputable print editions all have them; why not all ebook versions? Why not THIS one?Except for this defect the Bedford Park edition provides easy access to each title and to the chapters within each title. It provides the finished and unfinished novels plus a sampling of juvenilia. And the formatting is fine--except for the aforementioned lack of any indication of emphasis throughout (a defect which seriously mars an otherwise fine set).One can get virtually EVERYTHING Austen wrote for the same price ($1.99) from Delphi and from Palmera. (To see for yourself, type ""Delphi Austen"" or ""Palmera Austen"" in the Kindle Bookstore searchbox.) Delphi uses italics in 4 of the 6 major works; Palmera in 5 (so I lean toward Palmera). I did NOT recommend this Bedford edition when it was priced at only a dollar, and I do not recommend it now at twice that.",1,0,0.610021786,0.077995643,NY

Billy Buchanan returns to Spearfish as a favor for a business associate.  He agreed as a favor but also because it would give him a chance to re-ignite the spark from his high school flame Eden LaCroix.  For the past ten years he has regretted walking away from Eden. Eden has spent the last ten years building a career and dedicated to the local community center helping at risk kids.  She hasn't had time for real relationships, just the occasional no strings attached hook ups with sexy Native American rock star Jon White Feather.When Billy and Eden see each other for the first time in ten years the chemistry spikes off the charts but Eden is determined to fight it because Billy is working on a project that could destroy her job.  He quickly sweet talks her into seeing him out side the project.  As things heat up between Eden and Billy and they are both realizing they still have strong feelings for each other...dunh dunh dunh....Jon comes home for a couple of days.  Billy and Jon decide they want to give Eden one of her darkest fantasies. BOY O BOY is this a hot menage!I really like Eden, even though she is worried about her heart and Billy leaving her again, she takes charge of her sexuality and is not scared to go after what she wants sexually.  As much as I liked Eden in this story, it is Billy and Jon who stole the story for me.  Both men are sexy and strong.  Billy is possessive, sexy, dominant and vulnerable, I absolutely adore the way he treats Eden and some of the insecurities he displays.  JON...oh my, he is my favorite, don't get me wrong I love Billy, but the way Jon treats Eden before, during and after the menage just melts my heart (among other things), Not to mention Jon is a sexy rock star.

You can also view my blog atreadersedyn (dot) blogspot (dot) comReview:I read Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryght as few months ago and am only just getting a chance to write the review. As I recall, this was the first sci-fi, paranormal romance I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Ms. Cade does a fantastic job of creating a believable, futuristic world of alien species and technologies dreamed of. While there is a lot of language used, somehow it fit. I suppose I can attribute such raw acceptance to the fact that this is a science fiction novel. Within my mind, as far as science fiction goes, anything goes. You just have to be open-minded enough to be able to both accept it and recreate it in your head. But I am no strange to the realm of science fiction. In books yes, but not with television. My Dad raised me on Star Trek, so from a very young age I was exposed to all types of creatures. It is kind of funny to watch the original Star Trek series now when you see how far we have come with special effects. As I got older I watched shows like Stargate: SG1, Farscape, all of the Start Trek spin-offs, and many more. But I digress. I believe my point it that such an exposure has allowed me to broaden my mind when reading outside of the box.Maybe I should get back to the book now. *coughs* Ahem. So Tryon is a Tyger and has been caught off world and mid voyage in the middle of his mating shift. Needless to say, he needs sex and lots of it - fast. The consequences could mean the deaths of many crew members should he be unable to satisfy the sexual need deep within. Calla is also a Tyger and took notice of Tryon when the voyage began, but when he looked right past her, her hope for a tryst faded and he instead became the object of her fantasies. Now she is the only hope for the crew and, well ... Tryon's only hope to regain control and ability to perform his duties.I can honestly say that I really enjoyed the time spent reading this story. It was the first time I have read Ms. Cade and I will definitely be back to read more of her work. Perhaps even within this series, The Orion Series. From what I found on the publisher's website, Tyger Tyger is the first book in the series with 5 books currently published. I wanted to share some other excerpts with everyone, but I am guest posting and thought I should try to keep it clean. I don't mind saying that I had one heck of a time finding passages that were ""clean"". This story is loaded with graphic sexual encounters, and dang! Let me tell you just how smokin' hot they are! Good lawd!That said, even with all of the sexually descriptive scenes, Ms. Cade manages to craft a workable storyline between them. I liked that Tryon is an alpha male that is unexpectedly paired with a strong female. Calla gives as good as she gets most of the time and inevitably, this dense alpha finally gets the clue that he likes it. Unaccustomed to females giving him attitude, Calla well and truly rocks his world. And in the midst of all of this is another component to the story. A group of terrorists has snuck on board and plans to sabotage the ship. The intruder is eventually left to Tryon to sift out. Meanwhile, Tryon makes a muck of his relationship with Calla. Seems crazy, right? A shifting male Tyger, his unplanned female mate with sass, a saboteur on board, the fate of many depending upon it all, crazy amounts of hawt sex, and a potential future relationship gone awry by the ever-present male without a clue. Yeah, I know. But it works and I was completely entertained by it. I mean if a shifting male Tyger and loads of awesomesauce sex don't grab you, then I really have no idea what else I could dangle in front of you. It is not a deep story that is going to explore the inner angst of the main characters, but it is entertaining at the very least.(Digital book purchased for personal library)",1,1,0.631641086,0.852656434,NY

Then, they fumble and stumble around because in this universe, night vision goggles were never invented.--The outside-the-dome citizens are emaciated, radiation-ravaged and prone to bleeding and dying at a moment's notice...except when the citizens are related to the main character. Then, they perform superhuman feats over several days with various injuries and little food with no apparent problems.--In a world where all the land is described as arid, lifeless and barren, half the characters drown their sorrows with a good cigarette. Which is made of tobacco. Which is grown...where exactly?--The author has decided that virtually every noun deserves an adjective and every verb deserves an adverb. Glass never breaks - it breaks softly. Honestly. No one ever stares - they universally stare coldly or hotly, and both words are apparently interchangeable to the author. I daresay there are 3,000 completely superfluous words in this novel attributable to useless adjectives and adverbs.Indeed, there are whole passages that are redundant and serve to do nothing to advance the story. In this universe, military men conduct 20-minute long conversations to debate the pros and cons of helping a stranded soldier in the middle of an epic battle, and the dialogue is incessant in its repetition.Even with an editor and a halving of the story (and believe me, it would be easy to cut this novel in half), there is simply no character development that makes you want to root for the hero or his family. Oh...and the sequel? It contains virtually no ties or links to the initial story.All in all, this is one hot mess of a book. With so many other quality independent titles and authors out there, I can't recommend this even at its current zero price.

156,156,"I was very disappointed with this book... not because I have anything against blonds (I am one), but because I figured that out of 500 jokes, there HAD to be some good laughs. I was wrong. First, I didn't count them, but I'd be real surprised if there were even 200 jokes in this book. Second, among those 200 possible jokes, at least 50 were repeated 2 or more time in different parts of the book. It's almost as if the writer kept a running list of jokes as he heard them, with no real concern about whether or not they might already have been recorded. Then he decided there MUST be at least 500 jokes here. Finally, to be perfectly frank with you, I do not recall laughing at a single one of these ""jokes"". Most were better described as insults, mistaking the degradation of a group of people for humor. Very ""7th Grade"" material. Don't bother with this one. It's not worth the 99 cents.

158,158,"Rating:  4.5 starsThis book was a dark read and it is not anything like FSOG--it's about Master/slave and about a Dom/sub.  The story takes place at Judgment-a secluded fortress type mansion that holds hundreds of women captive and who will be sold into slavery. Callie first given the name Red because of her hair and later renamed Mischief by her Master was kidnapped and brought to Judgment. When Mischief arrives at the compound she fights her captives and pays the price. Her defiance earns her attention from Tane-the head Master-on her first night at Judgment. Her defiance continues as does his fascination with her.Her defiance continues and that is what earns her the name Mischief. She is eventually broken when she tries to escape and lands in the arms of Tane. He sentences her to a caning and waiting she does something that earns her a total of 30 strikes of the cane.While we are learning about how Mischief was captured and tortured into complete submission the author also dives into the physiological state of Mischief. There are other interesting aspects to this story.  There is a whole hierarchy of slaves-the top being Personals.When presented with a real chance of escape I was shocked at her response-which really just goes to show you how beaten down and broken she really became.  Overall, there are some twists and turns in this story and there is ALOT of violence and some steamy scenes. I found myself talking to my iPad because I was baffled, appalled, or just totally shocked by some scenes.Thanks for reading my review!!",1,1,0.563380282,0.563380282,NY
159,159,"I wasn't familiar with author Joe Hill's writing, so I figured this Kindle Single would be a good introduction, and it was. ""The Black Phone"" is one of the stories in Hill's book 20th Century Ghosts. [Note: the Amazon book description is for four different stories; only the last description that begins with ""John Finney..."" applies to ""The Black Phone.""]In the story, John Finney has been abducted by a man dubbed by the media as the Galesburg Grabber, a fiend who has already kidnapped and murdered several kids in the area. John found himself alone in a dark, cold basement that held only a toilet and--surprisingly--an old wall-type telephone that wasn't even connected. As John lost hope and despaired of his fate, he heard the old telephone ring. Was it his frightened imagination, or was someone else really on the line?I enjoyed the story very much. The storyline could have led to some explicit nastiness by the villain, but it didn't. After steadily building up tension, the story's climax was a surprise, but in the context of the story, it was a logical ending. To say anything more would be a spoiler.In a surprise twist, the author has hidden a second story, ""Scheherazade's Typewriter,"" in the acknowledgments after ""The Black Phone,"" so you're actually getting two stories with your download. ""Scheherazade's Typewriter"" was a very short but clever story that gave a new meaning to the word ""ghostwriter""!",1,1,0.662207358,0.58425521,NY

170,170,"I really didn't expect to like this story so much since it is for a younger reader than myself. I wanted to read it due to the title, Off The Grid. It seemed like a strange situation for these kids to get into. Living off the grid myself, I thought the book would be more about living that way, than a bunch of underage kids on an adventure. Well, what can I say? The story got me caught up in it and I kept reading. It was a fun read and I enjoyed it very much.This is a story of a family who had recently lost their father and had to move from their home to their grandfather's ranch that their mother had inherited. They sold everything and packed up the car and headed to Promise, Oregon with just enough money to get there. Along the way things happen and they get separated from their mother and are on their own. With the fear of being picked up by the police and put in a foster home without any parents, they manage to get to Oregon on their own.The characters were believable, and once they got to their grandfather's farm, the story really took off for me. I liked the sense of humor the girl telling the story has and the fact that she played a guitar and had an addiction to candy. I loved the part where their grandfather's preps kept them fed and able to survive on their own.

171,171,I'll be rereading this book a couple of more times; albeit much faster each time.  Great book for anyone looking to understand the process of mind maps and mapping.,1,1,0.666666667,0.7692307690000001,NY
172,172,"This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy. And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was. However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless. Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities. This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: ""A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts. In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column. Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram.""And how does that help me? one would ask. Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words. Visualization is the key word here. Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story. ""One idea is interconnected with many other ideas,"" we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes. It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process. The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways.""...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become. A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw. Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map. This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind."" Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works. I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try. Well, all that has changed. I now find this subject as intriguing as they come. As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals. I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right. And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose. Is it a self-help manual? In a way it is, but it's much more than that. To use a metaphor I'd say that this is a guide of how to use the GPS of your brain to find the destinations you desperately seek, and need.",1,1,0.6055155879999999,0.6055155879999999,NY
173,173,"Thoroughly interesting and informative, a `Mind Map' is basically a diagram that you create which organises your thoughts on one page. This book takes you through step by step processes to create your own and shows you every day applications for them.Allow me to quote from the first paragraph from the book - ""We live in the information age, which means that our problem is less one of obtaining information and more one of retaining and organising all the quantities of information that we are required to ingest-both during our studies and afterwards.""This is so true of my life. I feel that my brain is so cluttered with so many muddled thoughts that I can't easily access things I need and am left feeling confused and disorganised. Mind Maps is a tool that will enable me to use both sides of my brain rather than one; thus enabling my brain to perform 5-10 times more effectively. Show me a person who doesn't want that in their life! It simplifies complicated information by breaking it down into a diagram that delivers the information in a quick glance `map' rather than long laborious lists which are hard to digest.I can see that it would have great uses for students, writers or anyone giving a presentation. I personally am non academic and live on a homestead farm; for me in everyday life I can see several uses for planning my garden and renovation projects and to solve problems that crop up therein. I can also see it would be beneficial to estimate a timescale to these events. At the moment I seem to have list upon list of countless tasks that now seem insurmountable. I plan to sit down with a large sheet of paper and create my own Mind Map this very evening.The book also includes access to free software. One is web-based, so with a quick click of a link, I was able to start using it right away. The other options are nice as well, though you have to download and install them on your computer.

194,194,"William sent me a copy of this book, my very first ever request to review, so I'm honoured and delighted to do so!  Now I'm an anti-Harry Potter sort of person, so when I saw an amulet was involved I was a little wary. I also come from a completely different writing culture. I needn't have worried!  William has the gift of writing , well what I'd call young adults stories, though anyone could read this and be blessed. He has that knack which pulls you into the perspective of Brian, and tells the tale from a child of his age's point of view. The whole text has for me that wonderful fairytale feeling that I love in the Elizabeth Goudge stories such as the Little White Horse.Brian is maybe old for his age due to the abuse he has suffered in his life but he also acts just like a teenager.  His journey to find the Living water is has great narrative tension and I'm glad that it went on long enough after the climax to make the ending balanced and it sort of ties in to the supernatural of the story.I began thinking, ok, so this is a magical story in many ways, just how would this appeal to any teenager?  Its adventure with a twist of romance, reality and excitement. Yet as a Christian, how is this tale justified. (see my standpoint above).  Of course William related this to the Native Americans, and has a bible verse. Then it hit me, maybe I'm being dense, and William  had this in mind but the whole book is one huge allegory or metaphor.  Come to me and drink the streams of living water (John 4, v 13-14) . As Christians, we all seek and drink the living water of Christ and our lives should then reflect and bless all around them. This is what Brian and Rachel did with their lives. It gives you the gospel message that through Christ we can be all things and bless others.  This book does it in a way acceptable to the teenage mind if they can see it!

195,195,"Part allegory, part coming of age, part spiritual awakening, this book is about a teenage boy living with an alcoholic mother and a fragile younger brother. Even his mother is quick to tell him the truth that the solution Brian thinks he has found to his sad and sometimes terrifying life is the wrong one. Will his little brother pay the price for his short-sightedness, his simple plan to ""make everything better""?When his easy fixes begin to crumble to ashes Brian is forced to examine his own motives and what is really important to him. An elderly stranger and a desperate, outcast new friend push him to search for the real power to make the world a better place.What is the source of healing, of restoration, of hope? Is it in magic and ancient legends or is it closer to home, from a different source, far from ""the center of the world""? The physical quest and the spiritual one are intertwined all along the way.",1,1,0.607526882,0.669496322,NY
196,196,"I cried real splishy splashy tears, the mark of a good book. This was such a moving and thought provoking story to be aimed at a younger audience but I think older readers would enjoy it too. William Woodall really gets into the mind of a 14 year old boy. What I like about this author is that he's not trying to be like anyone else. He's not copycating C.S. Lewis like so many others try to do. He's not afraid to approach the Christian aspect but he doesn't beat anyone over the head with it either.  His work is unique and I really enjoy it.I think he should have included discussion questions at the end of this book because there are so many ways to start a conversation with the many themes it contains.I would give the writing 4 stars only because the characters weren't as distinct as in other books I have read by this author. For instance, the names Brandon and Brian were so similar I kept confusing them. I thought the two main characters could have used something in their speech to set each one apart. I really enjoyed the unique way he has of putting things though. Here's an example.""Nor did he dream, except the sweet and simple dreams of the pure at heart, of the kind that nourish the soul but are never remembered.""I should also mention that the writing reminded me of a bedtime story in places. Some people might find that a bit distracting but I felt it added to the fairy-tale fantasy feel. I give the story line 5 whole stars. I'm sure someone has written about similar things but this felt original to me.The Christian aspect I'd give 5 stars also. It is very appropriate for the intended YA audience but also appealing to a much wider age range. I could see reading this book in a homeschool setting. I guess because there are so many nuggets of truth hidden in there. It's about Heaven. It's about bad things happening for a reason. It's about deciding for yourself what matters most in life. It's a really good book!I am working on his short story collection next.Note: I wasn't asked to review this book and I bought my own copy. I'm a blogger and I have access to tons of free books.

197,197,"I started reading this book without knowing exactly what it was, but the first lines already caught me. The beginning is almost traumatic. Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed. Which happens often.If it were a movie in theaters, I would say that the ticket costed very little, if the price is divided by the number of deaths. And this aspect, if we talk about drug trafficking and especially action, is undoubtedly positive.Really an excellent reading.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return",1,1,0.599415205,0.6456365279999999,NY

I read the first few pages and thought I might might want to put it away, until I realized I was reading satire and a self-help book all-in-one.The book follows Beauty on her quest to turn her human, but sadly lacking husband back into the Beast who had won her heart before her marriage. Along the way, she meets other women who featured prominently in the Grimm Fairy Tales and listens to their tales of what happened Happily Ever After. Just like Anita Baker sang more than 20 years ago, fairy tales don't come true.Like many a woman who married because it was expected of her, or it was her duty, or she thought she could ""change"" him, these ladies share their stories of what went wrong, and finally, about what has made them happy.Along the way Beauty learns and grows, and like every good fairy tale, there is a moral to the story: instead of trying to change everyone around her and her circumstances to become what she wants, Beauty does the only possible thing she can do to make herself happy: she becomes what she needs instead of relying on somebody else to do it for her.

The group has changed and added on during the years, each man adding a few choice members, but the core group remains. Each book is about a specific member or adventure of the group, so it could be considered a stand alone, but as you get into the higher number books, it becomes more difficult to follow the story without knowing the supporting characters from that core group of family/friends.This book is about Ashkoda Paignton, a half Indian/half British doctor whom we first met when he was suffering from a debilitating disease and was only a teenager. His mother's use of Indian Ayurvedic medicine helped heal one of the Rakehells in the"" Model Master"". Since then, she met and married another of the group and had two children with him, making Ash the step son of one of the Rakehells.Returning home from London to join a medical practice, Ash comes upon a young woman he is acquainted with being mauled and assaulted in the woods.

If that isn&#8217;t more bang for your buck, I don&#8217;t know what is.But I&#8217;d have to say that 65 proof is not only a good introduction to this author, but you&#8217;re also getting many genres across the board and you&#8217;re saving money by buying this book.This massive ebook collection is separated into 4 parts: Jack and Friends (any stories related to his mystery thriller series starring heroine, Jacqueline Daniels), Crime stories, Horror stories and Funny stuff.You&#8217;re led through these stories, and through his publishing career, as the author himself gives a brief intro to each story. Once you become familiar with his wit, it turns into a major selling point for each story. I&#8217;d sometimes laugh as he jokes in between them as he sets up the next tale.

But he came up with some really clever stuff. My favorite stories had to be the ones with Phineas Troutt, a hard-boiled dying man who generally doesn&#8217;t care about ruffling feathers or dishing out some old-fashioned justice.

Followed byOnly In My Dreams.Books 4 and 5 are available as a paperback anthologyAnimal Attraction.Plot:Now pretty much healed, Belle is off to join her Mate in the Poconos. Will she find acceptance as a Puma in a Pack of Wolves?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 2167 kindle locations, 25,969 words, but finishes around 1800 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent.- Belle (Belinda) has made appearances in all the previous books. First, she was Olivia's backup babe. In Book 2 she was Max's wannabe Mate. And in Book 3 she is injured trying saving Sheri, the fount of all Blonde jokes, and finds her Mate while healing.- As the fourth book in the series, ""Steel Beauty"" picks up as Book 3 concludes, with Rick wanting to take Belle home. The book proper begins in February, three months of PT later, and as she heads off to the Poconos to join her Mate and his Pack.- Includes excerpts fromForsaken Talismanby Ashleigh Raine,Called by Bloodby Evie Byrne, andVery Much Aliveby Dana Marie Bell.- There are two ""free read""s available on the author's website giving us a little epilogue of Rick and Belle - ""Little Red"" and ""'Twas a Coyote Christmas"".- The Poconos Pack have their own series. First bookFinding Forgivenessis m/m and tells the story of Ben Malone (Marshall) and Dave Maldonado (Beta).Opinion:Another good, solid story in Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series, linking the Pumas with her new series on the Poconos Pack. It's certainly interesting and opens a whole new avenue of shifter romances. Tossing in some telepathy and a holiday resort, it should make a good new series.As far as ""Steel Beauty"" goes, it's a nice romance. Belle proves herself to be everything a Luna should be - strong, caring, intelligent - and Rick is a lovely Dominant Alpha with a loving streak. It is an easy paranormal romance with explicit bedroom scenes and a HEA. It fits well into the series.""Little Red"":When Rick finds the costume Belle left him for the Halloween party, he's just about ready to kill her. But when he saw her, and the additional goodies, he knew this would be a very memorable party.A little story emphasising the joy in Bell's stories, especially once we have our HEA with caring, happy, respectful, loving h and H. It's sweet, erotic, and very original. Definitely worth a look.""'Twas a Coyote Christmas"":Rick tells Belle a Christmas story to ease her pain.Sometimes an author just wants to pop in on her characters and give her readers a little smile - and that's exactly what this is. There's nothing too it except maybe a little introduction to some of the characters in future Poconos books. But that's okay. it's a few pages to make you smile.-CR-",1,1,0.698275862,0.870689655,NY

242,242,"It is an interesting book in many ways. To be blunt, I find the ending to be an easy cop-out to avoid taking things to their natural conclusion. And that's the only reason why I don't rate it 5 stars to be honest.This book is a first-contact book, but it's much better thought out than most other of the genre. There are logical reasons why there hasn't been much if any contact before, and there are logical reasons why when contact is established, it's found that the universe is filled with life and other sentient species.I found the science parts to be just enough to make it believable, and I have real respect for the care the author has taken in making the world seem logical and plausible. In addition, he doesn't turn to magic or 'just how things are' in order to solve something which can't be solved in any other way. Except - of course - for the end, which I'll get back to.The politics of earth are logical as well. I see some have reacted badly to the US being perceived as the 'bad guys' - but to me, the US here are the good guys, they simply can't trust the bad guys on earth and the natural conclusion to that, is that things get worse not better. But, I don't see it as the fault of the US or the western nations - I see it as a natural conclusion of the tension between nations, and that some of the 'bad' states simply can't be trusted. Normally, this sort of politics don't work for me in science fiction, but here - it does. Because the author doesn't condemn unnecessary, instead he logically points out the differences where they are, and let the logical conclusions happen - even when they are bad.And I do enjoy the characters, and how they interact and what their abilities let happen.But ... the end feels forced. The author does resort to 'magic' or 'faith' or 'God' or whatever you want, to let it happen. And ... I feel that everything is wrapped up too neatly.(SPOLER ALERT)It simply feels to me like the author took parts of the ending of watchmen and tried to make it work but without the emotional impact or the vilification of an outside source. It feels too easy to me, and how everything is neatly fixed and everyone falls in line, through what in my eyes is basic manipulation. People simply don't change their minds that fast, and I have a real hard time believing that the majority of the aliens would change their opinions that fast when they don't have the incentive that humanity does).(SPOLER END).In the end, I give it 4 stars and I recommend checking it out.

243,243,The first thrd of this book is taken up by very lengthy discussions of  technology and maths.  I could not get a hold of the hero at all.  He did not capture me and I could not identify with him. He was a techie and was naive and shallow and had a teenager outlook.  This is fine as he has spent his whole adult life cooped up with a smart computer and his maths problems.  However he just didn't cut it for me as the hero.  I found him frustrating.

I can see that.&#8221; But it&#8217;d been years since my early OMG-I-LOVE-Ilona binge, so I decided a reread was in order.And here we are.Some time in the indeterminate future, when space colonization was the new Big Thing, humans began to genetically enhance themselves. They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question.

286,286,"A balding, 60-year-old who lives with his mother is our unlikely but lovable hero! When some of his classmates from high school start getting killed, he launches his own un-official investigation which drives the local police crazy. It had just the right amount of humor and suspense to build a fine story. It was going along at a five-star pace, but the ending had, in my unique opinion, some unnecessary twists and turns which added a little to the story line. This is not to say that overall it wasn't a great book, it is just that it could have ended successfully in about 30 or so fewer pages. The main character, however, made the book and is firmly locked in my memory!",1,1,0.579710145,0.766505636,NY
287,287,"I am revising my review DOWN to one star, based on this author's responses to negative reviews, including mine. First he says he's not getting into ""a pissing contest"" with me, yet he had no trouble doing so with three or four other one-star reviewers (which he conveniently disremembers)...excuse me, one exception: He sicced his ""professional editor"" Sally Berneathy on Mr. Spadaro.Among one-star comments: ""reminded me of Nancy Drew...could have been written by a teenage girl,"" ""silly,"" ""makes no sense,"" ""dialogue is horrible,"" ""complete boredom,"" ""story is implausible,"" ""cheap and nasty,"" ""absolutely appalling,"" ""one dimensional as if a 13 year old wrote this,"" ""pedestrian,"" ""a first draft that appears to merit no further effort,"" ""bad grammar, syntax, punctuation...completely unrealistic characters, pages of pointless 'cute' banter that no one who has ever actually talked to an adult would dare call realistic,"" ""the text is simple, the plot is simple, the characters are simple,"" ""Moats should have paid me,"" ""who are these people that gave it a 4 or 5 star rating...I hope they don't live in my neighborhood,"" ""...even at this price (free) this book is a ripoff...who edited this? Someone's baby brother?"", ""reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,"" ""writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,"" ""writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,"" and Mr. Moats calls ME ""mean"". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.And the final nail: ""All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good."" AMEN.""Holy crap,"" he said, then put it between covers, titled it ""Classmate Murders"" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.Let me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be ""stupid"" and ""jerks"") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?And on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an ""unofficial civilian advisor""?And the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the ""closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation"" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.Another sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.That's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of ""Classmate Murders"".After reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist ""attributes"" is up to the reader to decide.About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% ""believable"" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, ""Vegas Show Girl Murders,"" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get ""Vegas"" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.For those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, ""has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being."");5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;8.) No cliffhanger ending;9.) Grammar and punctuation police, have at it, examples of what you will find:""She carefully taped the ends together and produced a nice spark."" (tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)""My curiosity was peaked.""""...but no one seems knows where.""*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER",0,0,0.674103586,-0.054316069,NY

Here are my two reasons why.Reason #1:  The story was intriguing in the beginning, but the ending really pissed me off.  The ending was like a bad roller coaster ride.  It was just horrible!Reason #2:  I found the story very unbelievable that the chief would say there are not enough people, especially during a serial killing spree.

296,296,"Opening line: ""The long, wet spring had finally turned the corner into a Connecticut summer so glorious that the residents of Old Wethersfield decided among ourselves it had probably been worth the wait.""The protagonist, Kate Lawrence, and her daughter, Emma, are out for a walk, watching the swans in a local pond, chatting about their immediate plans. Kate snaps photos of the swans - two parent swans with their four little cygnets - to document their progress.Kate is co-owner of MACK Realty and Emma, a paralegal, is launching a real estate law practice with a friend. The morning walk mixes business with pleasure. Mother and daughter admire properties as they hike ""the loop"" where ""nearly every Cape Cod, Colonial, Victorian and farmhouse along our route shone with fresh paint and liberally applied elbow grease.""So what can go wrong on such a glorious summer morning? The answer waits in Kate's office. Someone has sent her the stinking bud of a corpse flower and a clipping about the plant's anticipated flowering at the end of June. The anonymous gift is wrapped in a sheet of paper with scribbling in the margin: ""It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you. And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink.""The poison pen letter is almost ignored in the confusion that results when a plumber finds a skeleton hidden in an historic house belonging to ""the Henstock girls."" The ""girls"" are the spinster sisters Ada and Lavinia, now in their eighties.By the time the cops arrive, the skeleton has disappeared. It promptly turns up in photos Kate took of the swans swimming serenely in the pond, and the anonymous letter writer strikes again. There's another clipping about the stinky corpse flower and this time the scribbling reads: ""The lovesick, the betrayed, and the jealous all smell alike.""So much for a ho-hum life in the quaint little town of Wethersfield.The poison pen letters seem directed to Kate, who is on the verge of cohabitation with Armando, an attractive South American transplant who is the controller of a telecommunications company. However, the letters could as easily be directed to her two partners: Margo, a southern belle who is in a relationship with a cop named John, and ""Strutter,"" a Jamaican immigrant, whose husband is also named John.Kate is a magnet for trouble. She's tailed by someone driving a black van. The man knocks on her door late at night. Does she call the cops? No, she calls one of her partners and the cops come swarming in. Meanwhile, the plumber who discovered the skeleton in the Henstock house is nowhere to be found - fake ID, non-working cell phone number.And what about those pesky letters? When Kate is mugged in a parking lot, the investigation kicks into high gear.Kate is an amateur sleuth in the tradition of Miss Marple and Jessica Fletcher, attuned to the people in her small town, pooh-poohing any perceived danger to herself, quick to give others the benefit of a doubt.Some minor nitpicks: In one place, Kate's relationship with Armando lasted 8 years; in another it's 7 years; and in yet another she has known him for 5 years. Also, Margo's speech is full of dropped ""g's"" when a couple of instances would have sufficed.This was a comfort read that I hated to see end. Like Kate, I was caught up in the goings-on in Wethersfield, curious about the skeleton and the fate of the two old sisters and wondering how Kate would adjust to Armando's moving in with her.",1,1,0.651230101,0.790738061,NY

Some red herrings and suspicious characters made this a satisfying mystery as well as a fantasy. I enjoyed the fact that Miranda's character as a normal middle aged woman trying to solve a very strange mystery was very believable. In general I found the book was unput-downable!

299,299,"This fabulously written book drew me in.  Miranda's a little like the wife in the movie True Lies, she lives simply to take care of her husband the lightkeeper, and her two boys.  But she loves deeply, and she takes action when her husband disappears. She is naive and finds herself in a foreign world with the only resource of herself to rely upon.  She stumbles around not knowing what a morass she has placed herself into. Nothing is at it seems. She can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. This character development and plot is a study of subtlety. There is enough suspense and mystery to intrigue the reader to stick with Miranda. I love Miranda. I love devoted mothers and wives.  I really love that this author made the power of love be the guiding motivation for our heroine.  This is not an action genre book.  Which makes it all the more delicious.  This is a real life fantasy, sci-fi, magic story that you can't quite pin anywhere.  The writing is superb.  The reviewers who didn't like this book are probably needing 'in your face' stimulation that is fast and dramatic. This is a book to be savored and tasted. It's like engaging in high tea with Devon cream and croissants. You soak in the ambiance, smell the salt air, skirt the garbage and stay alert to being followed.  This is the most courageous of heroines because she diligently continues her search with her inadequate knowledge. She pieces together the mystery of her husband. She continues on in the face of complete unknowing - which is one of the greatest challenges we each face in our own world. She continues on even when everything she knows turns upside down.

By that time I also didn't particularly care for the main character, though I liked her older son. I found the constant references to the missing husband rather irritating, especially since the author doesn't tell us who Alexi was until his mystery-shrouded name had been sprinkled through the text five times.  One reviewer liked the lack of explanations in the book, but I don't enjoy passages that make me feel like the author is trying to play games with my head.  If the character doesn't know something, I'm OK with not knowing it, but pages of gloomy ""Alexi is missing"" with no explanation of who he was to warrant this attention made me grouchy.  I skipped to the end to confirm my guess and didn't feel any need to fill in the missing chapters.

At first she is treated as a bit of a country hick, like a jilted wife and more or less like someone who is more trouble than she's worth, but Miranda is nothing if not determined! The relationship between her and her husband was sweet.

Have you ever joked about how in books and movies you never see people eating or going to the bathroom? This book is a testament to why that is. It is not interesting to read about. The story has a lot of potential--a suspicious disappearance, a mysterious cat, shady politicians, a police cover-up--and despite all this the protagonist spends most of the time getting her train ticket punched. The author makes a big deal about the strange cat who follows her around, but once they get underway it literally does nothing but poop in the hotel room. The title should be ""Miranda Eats a Meat Pie for Dinner"" because that's all she really accomplishes (Seriously, someone should count up all the time they mention meat pies because it's a lot. I would do it but I think my eyes would melt if I read one more boring word of this book). It's really painfully obvious from the beginning what happened to the husband, and who is the bad guy, and the ""truth"" about magic. I am mostly annoyed that the author took the time to create this whole interesting, complex universe and then didn't do anything with it. The parts about the magicians are waaaay more interesting than Miranda reading a newspaper. Which she does. A lot. I only finished it to find out what happens, and that was disappointing too.

317,317,"This book was bad on every level.The plot was pretty much nonexistent. There was a small thread of ""escape Bedlam"" that was just unbelievable and after pages and pages of nothing it was accomplished in a spur of the moment afterthought way.  From what I could gather the plot line consisted of absurd sex scenes (really? hours after meeting a filthy, epileptic crazy man she is ""tiddling"" on the floor of an insane asylum with him? really?) interspersed with, well, not much more.The hero was a sniveling, blushing ""genius"" with no real depth.  If he blushed or ""brushed away a tear"" again I might have had to break my kindle.  The heroine was a self-centered little sleaze.  Her first concern was always the crazy man she had just met, not her totally incoherent sister or anyone else who had been there for her through all of her troubles.The editing started out okay, for a cheap kindle book, but it was almost like by the end even the editor/proofreader was just skimming as the spelling and punctuation errors increased dramatically.The dialogue was unbelievable and almost painful to read.  The H & h's soliloquies of ""love and devotion"" were nauseating in the way they went on and on and on page after page all the way through.  We get it, they love each other like no one has ever loved before and will be there for each other forever and would give up their lives for the other.  There were times when a character would use a phrase or word that was just not true to the time but in the whole scheme of how bad this book was this was minor.I am still not sure what the heck happened in the ending.  I know there were tears and ""happily ever after"" with the promise of more to come---not for this reader though!--after a silly chase scene where it all ""came together"" and all made sense to everyone---not!The supporting characters were as inane and uninspiring as the mains---none were developed in a way that made them feel like real contributing parts of the story.There is so much more I could comment on that made this book bad, but I have already wasted too much time I will never get back on it.",0,0,0.5651162789999999,0.10872093,NY

323,323,"Of all the Jules Verne ebook compilations containing 30+ titles currently available in the Kindle store, this Halcyon Press edition is pretty good. An active TOC pinpoints specific content. I am particularly happy to see a full and modern translation of ""20,000 Leagues"" by F.P.Walter (though he is not credited and his informative, introductory essay is not included). I'm also glad to see a true (""Professor Lidenbrock"") translation of ""Journey to the Interior of the Earth"" rather than the sadly all-too-common bogus (""Professor Hardwigg"") version often passed off as being by Verne. The other major works are translated reasonably well keeping in mind that these are older, public domain versions. I do, however, prefer a slightly different public domain version of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Dick Sand,"" but that's a mere quibble.I have two more quibbles. FIRST is that several times a graphic will not be included but the words ""graphic appears here"" will appear instead. SECOND is that italics are often represented by an underline before and after the emphasized word(s), __like this___, a confusing annoyance when the names of several ships (normally italicized) are being referred to. These are not deal-breakers but something you may wish to consider (and because of them I have subtracted one star). The formatting is otherwise okay.As to containing 36 works, the count is inflated a tad by counting the two parts of ""Captain Hatteras"" as separate entities and unnecessarily including (and counting) a duplicate portion of ""Mysterious Island.""  You really get 34 distinct tales (not 36)--but that is still a lot of Verne, though it is by no means complete. That honor goes to Delphi.Delphi has a truly complete set, though a dozen works (not yet cheaply available in public domain translations) appear in French for the sake of completeness. Since I am not fluent in that language, I do not fully appreciate their inclusion. I do, however, greatly appreciate the inclusion of about 20 (!) more titles--in English--than this Halcyon (or any other) set. This makes the Delphi edition the largest and most appealing to me (even though the aforementioned modern translation by F.P. Walter is not used in it).I would encourage you to search, sample, and compare because new Verne collections keep popping up all the time in the Kindle Store. Check to see which titles are included, if the main TOC is active and takes you to additional active TOCs (one for each book), and that the text is formatted to your liking. See if graphics and illustrations are included. The one you ultimately select will depend upon the level of your interest in, and the degree of your enthusiasm for, the writings of Jules Verne. If you want a substantial collection which includes the well-known great Verne classics, this Halcyon set (or a recent, $.99 one from e-artnow, which is worth examining) should be quite fine. But if you want even MORE (as in EVERYTHING), the very BEST is that all-inclusive Delphi set.",1,1,0.647840532,0.559800665,NY

A shy, curvy, and push over female that also happens to be a witch. A very powerful witch that is also the soul mate to said hot `Wizard of Oz'. After a fantastic `light bondage' (no ropes, think invisible bondage Wizard of Oz style) the Wizard is summoned back to Oz, and leaves our poor Dorothy with a way into Oz if she should need to come to him.This story was laced with hot erotic scenes and was even better than Not in Kansas. It added in more elements of the original story, you get a takes of Glinda, some `flying monkeys', and other mystical creatures that all over sexed and aren't ashamed of it. Let me tell you, if I had known that Oz was the land of sex, I would have hopped on the first Twister and taken my happy butt there a long time ago.I think this story had more of a pleasing effect on me because of the light bondage and spanking that was in it. This was one of the most pleasing erotic romances I have read in a very long time. The fantasy was great, the storyline was new and fresh, and I wish she would write just ONE MORE in this series so I can sit back and indulge in another trip to the land of Oz.Review also found at: [...]",1,1,0.591836735,0.7278911570000001,NY

I bought this because the plot seemed interesting--ancient vampire who has been disturbed by a young woman buying and moving in the old farmhouse over his lair.  It had promise--promise that the author couldn't fulfill.The book was written as if the author had a formula to write by: Introduce main characters, immediately have them have dream sex, then have male lead tell her that she is his one, and BTW he's a vampire and then have sex for the rest of the story.  No building up of the plot or tension between characters which lead to any type of climax (non-sexual type) and resolution.

This would be my second M/M book and I have to say I totally get the appeal in the genre now. It is just hot to read about two Alpha males go at it with one another. Add in one sexy as all get up Wizard and you have a M/M/M scene that is so steamy you are nibbling on your bottom lip and begging for more.The story had every element of fantasy you can ask for. To top it all off you set it on the backdrop of one of the most famous fantasy tales of all time, and you have a fast paced, sexy, erotic romance that rivals some of the best in the genre.I loved this story.

I was done with it about halfway through and only finished it because it was short and I felt that I needed to get to the end in case there was something there to redeem this series for me. Sadly, I didn't find this elusive redemption.Same as One and Only, I think that if you read the synopsis above, you can just skip the book, unless you want to read about some vampire sex. For me, because the character and story development was so lacking, I couldn't get into the sexy parts... I didn't really care, because I couldn't feel the connection. They were each others' destined mates and so everything was pretty much instantaneous for them, just like Atticus and Lissa. As soon as they had sex they knew they loved each other and that was that.

334,334,"I like old-fashioned westerns and I like to read those by Zane Grey. He is a particularly good writer, and many of his rip-roarin' westerns have rightly become classics. But be aware a goodly number of his books are more ""prairie romance"" than action-packed western, and in these there's often more huff and bluff than gunfire. Many of his books were not set in the ""old west"" of the past but in ""modern"" times, meaning contemporary to when he wrote them; these often depicted a rugged male abiding by a highly developed sense of fair-play and moral integrity (in contrast to the sneaky ""villain"" who did not), a chaste female heroine, misunderstanding, romance, and overall wholesomeness leading to a happy ending. Several works in this collection--though they  may be set in the western states--are not what we would normally call ""westerns,"" and others are baseball stories and nonfiction accounts of fishing and camping. Sadly the majority of his greatest westerns are not yet inexpensively or freely available in public domain editions. No matter what he wrote (prairie romance, baseball stories, fishing accounts, or classic westerns), Grey knew how to tell a good story, and his vivid descriptions are second to none.UPDATE 05-08-13: You may wish to compare this set of 26 to another Zane Grey collection recently published by Wildside Press as ""The Zane Grey Megapack.""

These stories are interesting in themselves and they inform us how ancient people thought and taught.In this tale a strange veiled lady rides a horse very slowly near a king, but it is impossible to catch up with her either by running or using a galloping horse. She turns out to be beautiful, and the king needs magic to win her. The story is filled with the usage of the number three, which is characteristic of many fairy tales of many cultures. Beside this episode there is a second and a third, all involving this woman and the king.

There are a number of wonderful works that incorporate the most well-known stories, including Susan Cooper's ""Dark is Rising"" series, Jenny Nimmo's ""Magician Trilogy"", Lloyd Alexander's ""Chronicles of Prydain"", and stand-alones like Fisher's ""Darkhenge"". That said, it's very hard to find an accessible Mabinogion, much less one aimed at middle grade readers.This book, although brief and although representing just a small part of the Mabinogion, is a wonderful place to start. Mr. Shepard has done a commendable job of distilling what are, after all, fragments and pieces of stories, into a reasonably coherent tale. He has also done a nice job of preserving the feel and flow of the tales while modernizing the language and shaping the narrative.And remember, these are basically 800+ year old versions of the same fantasy/quest/magic stories that fill the middle grade shelves now. That's pretty cool, (even for people who, unlike me, never wanted to name their daughter Bloudwedd).So, if you want a nice, tight, entertaining and understandable intro to the world of Welsh/Celtic myth,  this is a great find.",1,1,0.6949152540000001,0.6949152540000001,NY

On top of that, I got to meet shifters, gargoyles, fae and wraiths. A massive amount of content is jammed in to only one hundred pages yet I somehow wasn't overwhelmed or lost. If anything, I feel a little sad that it all had to end so soon.I immediately liked Kennedy. We're first introduced to her at work, bartending. She's having a stand-off with one of her patrons armed with a beer tap hose. Kennedy is radiating a playful, don't-mess-with-me vibe. My kind of heroine! Tristan, her sexy, feral boss is the second lead character. The tension between the two is obvious and gives us a glimpse of what's to come.One of the funniest parts of this novella for me was Kennedy fleeing enemies while driving on top of Tristan's unconscious body. At this point in the tale, these two are still in a platonic boss / employee relationship. Which made the situation all the more hilarious, not to mention awkward for poor Kennedy! Things can only heat up from here!In the midst of all the action, Tristan and Kennedy still find lots of time to get in on. I feel like a good chunk of this book was r-rated. The sex was drool worthy and each encounter managed to be hotter than the one that came before. If you're looking for a short read that'll get your rocks off, Primal Hunger is for you!Sydney Somers' first installment in her Pendragon Gargoyles series is amazing! The large variety of supernaturals paired with an imaginative story make this novella a good read but throw in the steamy goodness and it becomes stunning!

372,372,"I LOVED this story!! I would give it more stars, if I could. It was so well-written, I re-read it immediately, lingering on the details. I loved the dark, edgy, REALLY bad boy anti-hero, who was definitely NOT perfect.  The heroine is beautiful, but that is not dwelled upon as much as her character: good, brave, valiant and proud, but stressed, lonely and tormented, too. The writing is extremely good, top notch. The characters are extremely well-defined and believeable, especially for such a short work.  The sex is steamy, sensual and actually necessary to the story.  The editing is extremely good; no typos, grammatical errors, misspellings, or missing/wrong words.The fans of perfect-hero-and-heroine-happily-ever-after-all-wrapped-up-in-a-neat-package may not ""get"" this story.  The hero, Dardanus, is an assassin and womanizer:  highly intelligent, devious, bitter, and full of anger at the lifetime of cruelty and disrespect he has received as a royal bastard. Although he is a trusted advisor to Nestra, the queen, he is killing and scheming his way to take the throne from her, because he deems her too weak to rule the country effectively. But for all that, he is a man of principle (his own code, not others'), a patriot who loves his country.  The magic amulet Nestra wears protects her from attempts on her life, so he schemes to seduce her into removing the amulet, so that he can kill her. What happens is a very touching story of love and redemption, with a great twist.*Spoiler Alert* Even though many reviewers did not understand the ending (and so assumed it was NOT happily ever after), it HAD to be a happy ending, for this reason:  The entire story was told in the first person, from Dardanus' point of view.  Therefore, even though it ends with his belief that he will die in the morning (as a result of his actions), he is alive and telling the story, so the queen MUST have forgiven him.I got this as a free download, but this author's work is so awesome, I am definitely going to spend actual money to buy more of her work, ASAP.",1,1,0.629976581,0.629976581,NY

Right from the beginning, I could see how well-put together this story is, lots of descriptive detail, dynamic character and easy dialogue. I love short stories, and it's not that easy to take short fiction and pack it with substance and intrigue. This story is short but layered; there's some darkness to it, some magic and fantasy, and some seduction and scheming.The story is told in first-person from the POV of Sir Dardanus, but what makes that unique for me is that he's really an anti-hero, ""a bastard and ne'er-do-well, a murderer and a seducer of women."" Just what won't this man do in order to get what he desires? Even at the end, I was still a bit uncertain about what he'd actually do, and with the way the author left the final page, I have to wonder how or if this romance will continue. I choose to see hope and promise there, mixed with the darkness.This isn't a sweet, happy romance, Dardanus and his intentions a little too dark and moody for that. Also, I wouldn't say that this story is overly erotic (and I do think it needed to be more erotic in that detail), but certain aspects of the story do hold some sex appeal for me: the domination and surrender, the dark and complex hero, even the slightly rough sex scene and the tension behind it. Combined with the author's skill, all of those things produce an engaging short read and a hero who knows how to leave his mark.

384,384,"I'll start with reviewing my favorite story of the three novellas, The Sweetest Sin. I absolutely adore the two protagonists Landon and Julianna who were eloped five years ago. It should have been a happy ending but their marriage was annulled when Julianna's father, Lord Trevington, caught up to them and forced her to marry the Duke of Breckinhill. The story however, starts when five years later, Julianna, now a widow goes to Landon for help to save her sister Evelyn who their father has used to pay off his gambling debts. Naturally, Landon asks that she become his mistress in exchange for helping her find her sister. The book flowed rather nicely and despite it being a novella, I feel that it had a lot of depth and the characters, well drawn out. By the end of the book, I ended up rooting for both Landon and Julianna to get their happy ending. This story also introduces us to Evelyn who we will read about in the third book Sin's Mistress. I gave this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.In A Wager of Sin, Bianca, now a widow makes a bet with Hawk (Landon's brother). If she wins, all her debts will be paid and if he wins, she becomes his mistress. Pretty simple, right? Apparently, Bianca was married to Hawk's best friend and Hawk felt responsible for his demise when he had an accident because they were drunk the night before. I also liked this story but not as much as I loved The Sweetest Sin. The story was fast paced and also very steamy, perhaps more steamy than the second book. I enjoyed reading about Hawk and Bianca and loved Bianca's transformation into a headstrong widow into an independent woman. I give this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.The last book of the series, Sin's Mistress is about Evelyn, Juliana's sister, who we read out about in The Sweetest Sin.

Apparently he has been lusting after Evelyn for quite some time and had planned Trevington's downfall so that he can have her in exchange. He takes her to his estate in Devon and introduces her into his life. I actually thought this novella was okay. And yes I admit, it is not my favorite.

By the middle of the book he's extremely controlling and is playing little headgames with Marabeth that make me want to kick him almost as much as she wants to kick him.  And by the end of it, he's more than controlling, he's also patronizing.At the beginning of the book Marabeth is a strong-willed woman who has an unfortunate attraction to a man that she doesn't want to be attracted to.  In the middle of the book she's fighting for recognition from both her father and her soon-to-be husband - not just recognition, but respect.  She's fighting the good fight, demanding answers, working on projects for the good of the country and insisting that Sam stop treating her like a child and that he respect her work.By the end of the book she has given up everything to him.  She's incensed about how he doesn't listen to her, the fact that he's pursuing a project directly opposed to one of hers, and his constant patting on her head and acting like she's bubblehead... but as soon as he admits his love to her who cares about all that?  Hey, he said the L word... all those other problems? Big deal?!  We never get to see how they work out any of those issues, what happens with their conflicting projects, or whether Sam ever starts treating her if she has any brains.

390,390,"What a delightful novel! The characters were well-rounded and extremely likeable. I also appreciated the effort that was put into Povre's native language. In addition, the plot was intriguing and I didn't want to stop reading. I'm looking forward to more from this author!",1,1,0.698113208,1.0,NY
391,391,"I really enjoyed how this story developed.  Its a well-written Sci-fi depicting what happens when an alien race quietly tries to study earth and one of the members of the scientific team gets away from the group and is discovered by a human.  The world-building of the alien race was easy to follow since explanations came steadily throughout the story instead of one long monologue at the beginning.The characters' personalities and situations were established for some time before they actually come in contact with each other and then their relationship developed at a believable rate as they first had the culture/language barrier and then that period of just exploring their differences and similarities before it grew into something of a romantic nature.Not to say physical attraction wasn't there pretty soon after they met though Kent is a bear about it because he's recently sworn off women and here at his campsite remote from civilization he is joined by a female.Kent is a biology professor and scientist who was very athletic and rugged liking to bike and camp out far off the beaten path.  He is startled by Povre's differences when he first sees them, but soon adjusts to appreciating her exotic beauty and her sweet curious spirit.  Povre is of a race that has some psychic ability and she senses many things in Kent's emotions.  At first his anger frightens her, but then he becomes protective and kind.After getting over their mutual surprise, the rest of the story's action is about dogging all the government and non-government groups interested in capturing Povre for their own obvious reasons.  And at the same time, they grow closer knowing that Povre's people will probably come for her and they will be separated and there is always the fear that she'll be discovered and captured.From time to time, the story shifts to a third character, Povre's mission leader and father who was forced to leave her behind when she wandered away from their exploration group.  He follows protocol and gets the others back to their ship and safety even while despairing over his daughter's absence.  He knows that if she is captured, she will not be treated well.The plot held no surprises for me and it was simplistic, but that was fine with me because it allowed me to focus on the developing romance between Kent and Povre.  They really were good together.  He was trustworthy and strong for her while at the same time he was tender and understanding of what she was going through.  Povre helped heal Kent's bruised heart, gave him someone to protect and love as well as showed him the delights of discovering something for the first time when he watched Povre enjoy nature.  What I really thought was interesting is that though both are humanoid and share enough characteristics to be compatible, this truly is an alien romance.  They really saw each other's souls under all the surface differences.It was a nice read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light Sci-Fi Romance.",1,1,0.541284404,0.633027523,NY
392,392,"I received a free copy of this book for review.There is something for every reader in this book. It was filled with action and adventure and the supernatural. At times, the novel reminded me of a mix of Indiana Jones and Stargate and, at other times, like supernatural stories of demons and ghosts.The characters were each distinct and there were many characters from different groups. At first, I didn't think I could keep track of them all, but each character developed his own persona as the book progressed and after a while it wasn't necessary to be told who was talking, from the natural-born leader, the Colonel, to the practical and knowledgeable policeman Murphy to the inexperienced novice Kate. This was true of the main group. Then, there were the baddies and the FBI. Some characters also had other names or variations on their names. Some sections were a little confusing and had to be re-read.The quest of finding a piece of the staff of Solomon was similar to finding clues in a good mystery novel. After reaching each one, the reader was anxious to read more. I found myself thinking about the story each time I laid the book down until I picked it up again, mostly trying to keep the characters and timeline straight.Different stories were weaved throughout the book from different times and different people as the story unfolded. Some sections of the story took place in a castle in the 16th century and others in the wild west with Frank and Jesse James while others were in modern times with a storyline of ritual killings. This presented no problem because the first paragraph provided enough clues that the reader knew who it was and what was going on, with the headings of the segment of the story being prefaced by the date. This was used as a mechanism to mete out all the information in spurts throughout the book, a way of showing how everything within the novel developed through time to the present day. It was a good technique and kept the reader from being overloaded with information.I prefer novels to have a definite conclusion, but this book is intended to be the first in a series and left the reader at a point where he or she wants to read the next book and the next or however many more there are until the story ends. As I said, if you like action and adventure, magic, ghosts, demons, quests and serials, you will enjoy this book.",1,1,0.5490196079999999,0.742296919,NY
393,393,"The opening pages of this novel promise the reader an engaging story...but they ought to hold on because they have no idea just how much is in store for them.This was a very entertaining read for me. There is a little bit of everything in this novel from Egyptian mythology to tales of the old West; from the supernatural of ghosts and demons to Hungarian royalty and modern day law enforcement and military. It's impossible to sum up this book easily and that's one the biggest reasons why I enjoyed it so much. There was so much going on, the plot of the story skipping back and forth through time and place and highlighting many different characters. The authors deserve praise for the brilliant construction of their tale. They wound through the telling of this intricate story seamlessly and, although there was a lot to keep track of, I found it not only easy to remember who was who and what was what but I was enormously entertained and intrigued throughout.There are many different elements at play here in the first installment of this new series. Suspense, fear and humor are intermingled quite well within the plot and I thoroughly enjoyed the play between the characters. Each one of them was well defined and personable. There is mystery, murder, action and history all at once and in abundance in this novel. Because of this and the well-crafted cliff hanger that ends the first book, I am eagerly carving out some time in the very near future to read the second and third books as well.",1,1,0.554006969,0.821602788,NY

What turns into a one night thing turned into more though when she realized she needs to stay put a while. She quickly finds out that the house she took residence in isn't vacant, but owned by Braedan, who is in prison and due to be released soon. He comes home sooner than planned because she had wanted to be gone by the time he got back. It wasn't expected that Andrew would show up again but he did, Braedan scares him off, but it doesn't last for long. With everything going on Ainsley and Braedan do end up falling in love; they just don't realize it right away. Andrew does make one last appearance when he kidnaps her, but thankfully all he does is cause minor damage. The ending couldn't have been more perfect.

And Aggie, of course, has the coolest head and figures out the mixed up mess.This was a bit muddled, and the badly edited grammer did nothing but detract from the story, partially because the mistake (primarily with plurals and possesives and apostrophes) weren't even consistant.I  wouldn't go out of my way to find any others in the series, but might read another if I ran across it.

So many occurrences and this reader's mind was racing wondering who are the suspects?

Michelle Ann Hollstein  writes a story of grandmothers, movie stars, grandsons, a marine, a police officer, an adulterer, a murder victim, an inscribed piece of jewelry, a spurned wife, and a tramride up the side of a mountain during fall foliage season. This is a breathtaking ride that involves a dead body falling from the roof of one of the tram cars. It involves a search on foot through the woods on the side of the mountain, with treacherous cliffs unseen in the dark.

I wanted to find a good ""break"" in the story so that I could put the book down and do other things but I couldn't.  She writes in such a way that you just keep reading and reading. I really enjoyed Michael and Brigit's relationship in this book. It developed so well and I even had tears in my eyes when Brigit didn't want Michael to leave in a certain scene. I loved how they both wanted to protect each other and how well they could relate based on their pasts. The story in this one was better than I anticipated (I have a tough time reading about kidnappings since I am a mother and that is such a fear). It flowed well and was a lot bigger than the kidnapping mentioned in the summary, so for those worried about that, rest assured you can read this one without any problems. I also liked that the characters from the other books played a role in this book (Conrad & Julia, Lawson & Zara, etc). I adore Del and Ace in this series, too.

Nissa is a determined young woman, completely aware of what she wants, and when she also finds love, she is both delighted, and sad: happy to have found Hex, but sad that Aleron has such deep suffering and pain in him.

429,429,"The opening sentence of Janice Daugharty's ""The Sacrifice"" is, ""At first sight of the house, Ruth felt she heard the shock gong of a horror movie.""  Never did Ruth's thoughts serve her better.  She and her friend Mandy were on a long walk, and from the east bank of the Alapaha River in southeast Georgia Ruth had spotted a house she had never seen before.  Right in the midst of her own and her Grandpoppee's territory, someone had built a nice house on the river and it was hard to spot, difficult to see unless you walked right up on it.  Ruth just had to take a peek inside, but Mandy stayed back, not so brave as Ruth was in going up and looking in the windows of the assumed vacant house.  Ruth was wrong. There was someone inside and he fit the thoughts of ""the shock gong of a horror movie.""Rewis was an escaped inmate from the prison, along with another man, and Rewis was a serial killer.  There was no way that he would allow Ruth to run away now that she had seen him.  Mandy was terrified once she saw what was happening.  Rewis grabbed Ruth and eventually stabbed Mandy and kept Ruth as his hostage in a harrowing and suspenseful trip in a stolen boat down the Alapaha River on his way to Florida.  Using Ruth's life as insurance that he would get there, Rewis takes off on his trip with nothing but cruelty and murder and a loaded gun in mind as he makes his way down the river.As is characteristic of Janice Daugharty's writing, the scenery is described in detail so that the reader has no question about where the characters are and what they are seeing.  Each tupelo branch that was grabbed to pull the boat up on a sandbar to moccasins hanging overhead, I visualized each minute of their frightening and water-soaked boat ride moments as well as Rewis's murderous rampages and Ruth's moments of trying to escape.  I appreciate the flashbacks into the lives of the characters because these give the background of their lives before the kidnapping happened, otherwise the reader wouldn't know much about them.Ruth has faith in God and uses her faith to give her strength.  Although some readers prefer not to read religious references in novels, I'm sure it is not by coincidence that the kidnapped character is named Ruth.  When staying with the other escapee who had found her and thinking she was safe at last, Bobby, Rewis's escape partner, tells her the story of Ruth in the Bible and makes Ruth laugh at the humor he puts into it, but that earlier Ruth had made sacrifices, too.  The religious references are not overdone, but embolden the character and the strength of the 17-year-old hostage.This is a very suspenseful novel. I read it in two evenings because I couldn't put it down.  I needed to know what was going to happen to Ruth.  She had several attempts at escape and several opportunities to put Rewis out of commission, but her reasons for not carrying out any of these were for Ruth's own personal beliefs and fears.  She took the high road when she could have saved herself by sacrificing the lives of others.The twist at the end I never saw coming.  Other reviewers saw hints of it, apparently, but I'm glad I didn't because it made the end just that much better for me.  This book speaks of many different kinds of sacrifices, and from both of these characters we see the meaning of the word and of greater sacrifice.This is a highly recommended book for its character-driven plot, its richness of place and depth of character development and its place in literary fiction.  Characters and locations from other of Ms. Daugharty's books appear, also, which lends continuity to the settings of her wonderful stories of life in southeast Georgia.",1,1,0.570839065,0.63214777,CA

A mother that when she wasn't part of the abuse, did nothing to stop it. A lot of guilt because it was about survival. If he is hitting someone else, he isn't hitting me.An extraordinary look into how the mind, in order to cope, will shut down when necessary in order to save a persons sanity.Another prime example when your child does not like a neighbor or friend.

441,441,"[NOTE: This review pertains specifically to the free public domain ebook edition offered in the Kindle Store, though its remarks are relevant to any other edition to which it may (unintentionally and erroneously) be attached.]This is the ""classic"" old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved. But a good bit of the novel was left out, not so much that the story was greatly altered, but still not as Verne wrote it and intended it to be. Fortunately, there is another free public domain version available which I would encourage you to also download and read; this is a modern translation by F. P. Walter and it is unabridged. It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Verne Vingt Mille English. The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan.FYI: Be aware of two other excellent, new, modern transltions of ""20,000 Leagues"" available in the Kindle Store, one by Anthony Bonner (Random) and another by Mendor Brunetti (Penguin). Both are pretty good, though I lean toward Bonner's. You may wish to sample and compare those to the two public domain translations by Mercier and Miller (mentioned above).

450,450,"Budding Magic by L S Fayne, the first book in the fantasy fiction series, is a wondrous and beautiful telling of the tale of the O'Byrne Daughters.  The children of Aine and Keegan O'Byrne have all inherited the magic that runs through their lineage; this novel explores their lives during and after the passing of their parents. The cover does not do justice to the content. It is a magnificent tale, which is wonderfully written.The title of main character is passed from parent to child and then shared by the daughters themselves, much like the magic running through the characters' veins.  Each character is painstakingly crafted with just enough description to create a vivid and elaborate image in the reader's mind of this beautiful portion of Ireland and its inhabitants.  This novel enfolds the reader in the tale and builds its world around each to place him or her at the heart of the story.  Fayne has created a storyline, and the telling there of, that not only gives the reader a front row seat to the happenings, but pulls each into the tale to feel and be transported by its words.The plot is highly developed and beautifully written. Each movement of the characters affects his or her surrounding landscape as if Aine herself had charmed the very land.  The tale is straightforward, but far from plain.  Many writers would stumble trying to create such an intricate tale, but Fayne does so seemingly effortlessly and the reader is all the better for it.  From the Emerald Isles to the reader's hands, this is magic not to be dismissed.",1,1,0.542662116,0.673330083,CA
451,451,"Like the previous reviewer, I understand the point of view this story is told in. Unlike the previous reviewer, I liked it. Normally, I'm not a great fan of the ""tell"" style of writing, but as this story is actually portraying one side of a conversation, it's entirely appropriate.This story does, indeed, chronicle the lifespan of the narrator's breasts, from their sudden emergence to their ""betrayal"". There's a good dose of humour, both black and blue, and I found the emotional content appropriate and touching. The breasts themselves act almost as a character, and the narrator allows them to be both a physical and emotional barrier whenever she feels overwhelmed. The loss of such a big part (literally and metaphorically) of her lifestyle is handled with a cracked bravado that Ms. Brio conveys very well.This story is probably not for everyone, of course. As I said in the title to this review, it's a sweet story from an emotional aspect. But it has a hard edge to its bones. Just the kind of erotica I enjoy the most.",1,1,0.625592417,0.693666523,CA

454,454,"I read a lot, and it is really rare for me to not want to finish a book. I did finish this one, but I think only because I knew it was so short so it would be over soon. Part of the awkwardness I felt reading this book might be from culture differences, as this story took place in England and was written as such. I'm in the medical profession and had a really hard time with a lot of the British medical phrasing and can imagine an American layperson would be all that more confused. I've never seen so many exclamation points used in conversations before - I kept thinking that these people must be shouting at each other all the time! The romance felt very forced - I felt almost no chemistry between the main characters. Lorna (the ""heroine"") was going through a lot and had been through a lot, but I felt almost zero sympathy for her because all I could think was what a wimp she was. She complained about her job, she complained about her pain, she complained about her parents - she was just a miserable person.

458,458,"I really like this book. Ms. Marinelli has a good ability to grasp her readers with just enough detail, not too much. This novel is a good glimpse of hope and second chances with one's spouse.  But, I have a couple of critiques.First of all, Ms. Marinelli seems to forget, like a lot of modern romance novelists, that her readers have an imagination of their own. It is my humble opinion that people who love to read are also very creative, imaginative and inventive.  As a result, they only need to be guided and engaged, but left to piece the obvious themselves.  I specifically refer to the scenes that only a spouse and a wife should be a part of. Its cliche and annoying to encounter the unnecessary descriptions of these scenes in a book such as this one.This book is really beautifully written and throwing in a piece of what Hollywood claims sells only cheapens things.  There is a beauty in leaving some things to the imagination.  I challenge Ms. Marinelli to be different.  She is an amazing writer.  I challenge her to believe in her skills as a writer and protest the status quo of cheap romance novels.Secondly, I also challenge her to look into a faith in God that she may be holding back.  It seems she was tempted to attribute the 'coincidental' occurences in the book to Him, but she held herself back by only saying 'someone' was looking out for the main characters.  Of the couple times that she mentions God by name, one is at a moment to blame Him for what 'went wrong' and another is to reduce Him to a buffet style God that one can pull apart for the pieces that are convenient to us.  And with this again, I challenge her to be different.Believe it or not, for as many people who read romance novels for the 'steamy' scenes, there are that many more who read them for hope in something more.  For some the belief that love is possible, for others that there is hope after difficulties and for others perhaps a good and clean escape.  Maybe your temptation to include God is not a mere coincidence as He does lead to good and hope filled love.I truly loved this book and only gave it one star away from perfect because I choose not to share it with others for the first reason I mentioned above.  I found myself having to skip those pages getting an idea of what was coming.  I do appreciate the warning at least.  But, call it pruddish or whatever else you may but I still believe in there being a lot more said when sometimes nothing is said at all but instead just understood.",0,1,0.552894212,0.64231537,CA
459,459,"James and Lorna were drawn to each other from the very first. He was a doctor and she in medical school. When she became pregnant, they married, but she lost the baby. Lorna went into a deep depression where she shut James out. Their brief marriage ended in a divorce, but they never got over their few months of bliss. When a car pile up brings injured Lorna to James's ER, they are thrust back together, but the old wounds haven't healed, and Lorna is afraid to talk about the past.I hated the opening where May, the older nurse, was recalling all the evidence of James's sexual prowess. In fact, I was so disgusted I almost quit reading and deleted it at that point, but then it got better when Lorna, his ex-wife, came into the picture.

480,480,"At first I thought I would really enjoy this novel and there are elements about it which weren't too bad - the magical parts - but the heroine spoiled most of it for me. She comes across as shallow and a real twit.I know she had to get into the woods to fulfil the story but getting drunk, deliberately running out in the middle of the night and getting chased by The Beast was just plain silly. It was reminiscent of those old-time movies where the ""feisty"" girl reporter is told not to go into the cellar and of course, the first thing she does is just that. Izzy, told not to go into the woods by just about everyone she meets, does just that too.The characters were not ""fleshed out"" sufficiently for me to have much sympathy for them - we know next to nothing about Feathers, the son, Connor, or his father, Joe (who turns out to be an elf) or the abusive ex-boyfriend/husband/partner. His threats and leaving mutilated animals on her doorstep is not taken very seriously by the police.There is no back story to speak of which would explain the circumstances of Izzy's life - a few letters to her rellies is all the reader gets. The ending was abrupt and the last chapter jumps forward a year without explaining what's going on with Izzy, Feathers and Connor.

494,494,"Overall I enjoyed this story.Declan is down on his luck and desperate times call for desperate measures. Not sure of where his next meal is coming from and without a home, he takes a job at the Chicken Ranch working as a prostitute. ""Pride didn't make him any less homeless or fill the empty ache of a stomach that had gone too long without sustenance.""Killian is an accountant with a steady job and home. But he his lacking something in his life and a one-off, spur of the moment visit leads him to Declan.I like the way both characters are portrayed, particularly Declan. I felt very sympathetic towards his situation.Declan is proud and doesn't accept his situation. He looks for ways to give himself the life he desires including taking classes to gain qualifications. But he struggles to come to terms with the life he has made at the Chicken Ranch and doesn't feel worthy of Killian. He is waiting for something bad to happen. ""If his own father couldn't love him, what hope did he have of finding someone who could?""When things don't go smoothly, Declan almost believes this is what he deserves. ""The bad thing was, he wasn't even sure he had a right to be mad. After all, he was a whore.""It was a big plus that even though Declan works at the Chicken Ranch, this book didn't spend too much time focusing on happenings at the brothel. It was more focused on the development of the romantic relationship between the two men.I loved the slow and steady approach Killian took to their physical relationship and how much Declan appreciated sex with Killian. Even though he worked in the sex trade, simple kisses with Killian had Declan waiting in anticipation. ""Thankfully, he found the prospect of being with Killian completely different than work. The act was the same, but the purpose behind it was not."" and ""This wasn't just about sex. The actions were similar, but the level of intimacy was as diverse as night from day.""My only actual dislike with this story was the use of a couple of words which I personally find a bit of a turn-off: ""....Grave's tool.""

496,496,"Welome to the negative review of the book everyone else loved.Let's begin shall we.I will start with the plot. When I was first reading the synopsis the plot sounded intriguing, and I loved the idea of the disgraced book hunter, and the lost Dickens story, but for some reason it ended up not working for me. I think that sex was introduced too early on, and was a distraction from what I liked about the idea of the book rather than something that added to the story.I liked James for the most part, and was able to sympathize with his plight. Losing the job he loved, and the security in his world must have been terrible, and, having worked retail, understand how frustrating, exhausting, and dehumanizing that can be. Added to the stress of trying to make ends meet on part time work without any sort of benefits, it's no wonder why he does what he does.Sedgwick, on the other hand, I never developed any affection for. I found him to be blunt to a point beyond simple rudeness, and his excuses seemed liked those of a child rather than a 42 year old man who should be old enough to understand proper behavior, or at least how to make a sincere apology for his words. I found his behavior, after he and James had a falling out, to be almost stalker like, and added to that he seems to almost bully James into hearing him out, and accepting his half hearted apology. He is also described as having a full beard, which is not my thing, and with all the scenes of both men eating had me truly grossed out imagining all the crumbs it must collect (this is not meant as a slight to any of my friends who have or enjoy beards, it's just not my thing.)For me the worst part of this book was the sex. This book had some of the hands down worst written sex scenes I've ever read, and let me tell you I have read some truly terrible sex scenes. Let's go to the book for some examples shall we.""Like a suede glove grabbing me, stroking me..Like a hot black fist.""What the hell is that supposed to mean, and why a black fist?""The pump and pull was like a hammer striking the golden frames of angel wings, pounding them into shining, glinting pennons. Perspiration sheened our bodies and our breath grew harsher as we bent our backs and worked the forge, and then the wings began to beat, trying to take flight, moving faster and faster, and we seemed to lift right off the ground, right off the pillows, and bedding, and hang there transfixed as warm, white Halle-fricking-lujah surged through.And then we dropped back to earth, wet, winded and weak. Human again.""Seriously what in the name of pink plastic ponies did I just read? I had to look up what a pennon was because I had no idea. Merriam-Webster was kind enough to tell me it ""a long usually triangular or swallow-tailed streamer typically attached to the head of a lance as an ensign"" which only made the sentence even more of a mystery to me because it sounded like the author was alluding to something that would be forged, like something made out of metal, say a sword, but the word he used meant something made of cloth. Color me confused. It's also some of the sappiest, most awkwardly written sex I've even read, and that's including the het 80's romance I read in high school. Nothing about this works for me on any level, and that's not the only angel reference during sex there is.""It was like landing on a cloud - with an angel on top of me. An angel that tasted like cinnamon and chocolate and stardust.""Really, exactly how old are these characters supposed to be because it sounds more like some child's fantasy of sex rather than real, adult sex. Sedgwick has some sort of whipped chocolate cr&egrave;me brulee body cream souffl&eacute; that only adds to my impression of them as much younger than they really are.My least favorite of the sex scenes has to be the one I included in my updates, but it bears repeating.""and it was sadly like a hood over the head of an angel, but better safe than sorry.The angel continued to blindly feel its way to the hot, candy-slick center hovering tentatively above it.There is nothing about that I find sexy, and ""candy-slick"" I guess I don't find candy to be very slick. I think of candy more as sticky which makes this analogy all that less appealing to me.In summary I will say I found the sappy, miracle ending to be the final straw. If things had been toned down quite a bit, and the characters' relationship allowed to develop at a more natural pace I might have enjoyed this book. Had the mystery of the Dickens story played a more significant role, and the sex scenes cut back I would have happily given this at least three stars. Alas this was not to be.",0,0,0.582909461,-0.417090539,CA

Not that I am saying that is what was being done here, not at all, but that is my reasoning for avoiding most Christmas stories.Having said that, I loved this book!  I was immediately, completely drawn into James' world.  The story is so well balanced the humor mixed with the sadness and stress of the season, just when it is needed.  Both James and Sedgwick's loneliness, born of different experiences, made the story all the more touching.A delightful sweet read that will leave you smiling and, perhaps, as it did for me, wanting to explore more of Dickens' Christmas stories (unfortunately not The Christmas Cake).",1,1,0.56875,0.58266129,CA

499,499,"I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this book. I am so glad I did. I sat up late to finish it, it was such an enchanting story. This book reminded me a lot of Terry Pratchett's ""Good Omens."" It covered that much ground and I never knew exactly where this story was going next. Nothing was predictable.And there's so much going on, the story never lags. There's love of many kinds: Mother's love; passionate love; pure love; love of money; love of self; Love That Sanctifies. There is revenge: Revenge for imagined slights; revenge for poor treatment; revenge by living well; revenge because it just feels good. Old gods. Bitchy women. Crazy coincidences. The Independent Entity. And a HUGE dose of Karma.Is it great literature? No. But it's well written and it has a point. The characters are captivating and most of them redeem themselves in the end or get their just desserts. The story flows, the plot points move and they all match up. I can't wait for another book!Just one word of caution, though: If you're a prude, don't like foul language or adult ""situations"" and want your women pristine and your men ""manly"" in the classic romance novel way...this isn't the book for you.

511,511,"Mariah is not one to believe in fairy tales coming true, but little does she realize one might be in the cards for her. Just a year before while vacationing in Mexico she put on a wish bracelet (along with a couple of her friends) and wished for the one thing she'd wanted for years. Though Mariah writes off the whole thing as fantasy, she knows she must wear the bracelet until it comes off on its own. She forgets about the whole thing until it does fall off and she meets a wish fairy who swears Mariah will get what she wanted. It takes a little convincing, but she begins to believe when the man she wished for suddenly comes back into her life. The only problem is she is limited to forty-eight hours before the wish expires and there are some catches the fairy initially fails to mention that could ruin everything. Now that Mariah is finding love, she has to get her happily ever after and will do whatever it takes to make all her dreams come true.I admit I didn't expect much from this short novel. It sounded like something I probably wouldn't even be able to finish. Yet once I started reading, the story really grabbed my attention. Mariah is a strong and independent woman, but she isn't afraid to dream and take chances. She has a sweet and soft side that helps you relate to her. When Tucker shows up, you root for her to find the love she wants with him. I will warn he isn't quite as easy to relate to in the beginning. This could be due to the fact I am not much of a poker fan and this guy made a living as a professional poker player. Definitely not my kind of dream guy. Yet I hung in there for Mariah's sake and eventually found myself really liking Tucker as more of his background came out. Despite it being a short novel, you get enough details to help you understand the two main characters and feel like you know them fairly well by the end. Even some of the side characters were great and helped flesh the story out.There are a couple other things that could be considered both strengths and weaknesses for the novel. One, there are a lot of sex scenes and they begin early on in the story. I had hoped to get a little more warmed up to the characters first and that threw me off a bit. On the other hand, you learn a lot by what they are thinking and saying during those scenes. Tucker and Mariah met many years before so there is a lot of reminiscing even as they jump back in the sack together. Also, the author does an excellent job of writing sizzling scenes that most any romance reader could appreciate. I wish the story had been longer and more drawn out (there was a lot of room for growth) but I also understand writers like to tell the story as they see it. You don't have to deal with all the misunderstandings that are often used as ploys to prevent the H/h from finding their Happily Ever After (HEA) more quickly. It was refreshing to see the two characters forthright and upfront about their feelings without all the holding back you often see.There were a couple of instances where the dialog seemed a bit weird to me, but most of the time I had no problem with it. The ending was the best part. It tied everything up and even provided for some comedy (I won't say how, you'll just have to read it). All in all, this was a novel I don't regret trying and believe it is one most romance readers will enjoy. It looks like this is the first in a series so I plan to check out the ones that follow ""All In"". I have faith they will be at least as good as this one.",1,1,0.552238806,0.552238806,CA

They had a one night stand of mindblowing sex that she has never forgotten. In fact, Mariah has never forgotten Tucker at all! So, when she was told she can make a wish, she wished for one night with Tucker.A year later, a fairy from the Universal Wish Foundation tells Mariah that her wish had been granted.

The repetition was minimal and there were issues outside of the couple instead of things that could have been fixed with one or two sentences.Which made THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS a very nice read.Stephen has been gone, with no word, for months. He set off to find Emily's brother. Daniel has been returned to Emily, dead. As you can imagine, this has been very hard on Emily.Now Stephen is back, with no memory of marrying Emily and no clue where he's been, beside the tattoo, in Chinese, on his neck. While on the on the one hand Emily wants to fling her arms around her husband, on the other she really wants to smack him hard, or poison his tea. She knows that he was at his mistresses home just before he disappeared. HOW she knows that was never explained.That happens a couple of times in this book. Something is mentioned, but not explained. Lots of red herrings that don't go anywhere, and don't really fit with the story.To top things off for him, she tells him that they are the guardians of her niece and nephew. He really doesn't think that he signed on to be a father, much less a husband.Still, this was an enjoyable read.

The story line was interesting and the hero was imminently likable.When Stephen Chesterfield, the Earl of Whitmore awakens he is finds himself injured, with no memories of the last few months and married to his childhood sweetheart, Emily.  He is frankly stunned and disbelieving that they are married as he has no memory of their wedding.Emily has not seen her husband in months, he left very soon after their wedding and she is holding a major grudge and accuses him of all kinds of misdeeds.  She seems to truly dislike her husband and it is apparent to the reader she wants Stephen to remain her husband so he can protect and provide for her and her deceased brother&#8217;s children.Stephen&#8217;s memory does not return easily and Emily seems to resent him for it.  She is irrationally angry that Stephen cannot remember their wedding night.  This is just plainly ridiculous.  She is quick to believe the very worst about him.Stephen sets out to discover the missing pieces of his memory and it becomes apparent that someone wants him dead.  Even when the first attempt is made on his life, Emily displays little reaction.  I found her to be unemotional with Stephen unless she was angry.Later she begins to thaw toward the hero, but her earlier action and her inability to trust the hero had already cemented my view of her as an illogical (she never made any inquiries to her husband&#8217;s whereabouts while he was gone for months), self-serving heroine.",1,0,0.55033557,0.44966443,CA

531,531,"Marion Stein's Loisaida - A New York Story was one of my favourite novels of last year - The Death Trip is a novella and a very different beast to it's predecessor.The Death Trip is a more tightly focussed story than the cast-of-thousands Loisaida and unlike that book's unflinching realism and period detail (being set in the 80s Lower East Side) it introduces an sci-fi almost metaphoric element - the titular Death Trip. This is a new drug that is used to ease the suffering of terminally ill patients - by taking it they enter an unconscious state that feels like years spent living in their own version of paradise, but in fact takes place in minutes before the person dies.The central character is investigating the drug and the corporation that manufacturers and administers it, and Stein uses the drugs existence as a starting point to throw lots of ideas it the mix.  And this is very much a novel of ideas, and if the thought of characters debating ethics and ideas puts you off a book then this isn't for you (although there's plenty of intrigue, spot on characterisation, and even some romance too). Stein creates a pleasant moral ambiguity around proceedings - the question of whether The Death Trip drug really is a miracle or something sinister is left tantalisingly unclear. As such this is a book that requires some intellectual investment from the reader - I was reading this whilst the Tony Nicklinson right to die debate was in the press, and that very much coloured my response.Fortunately whilst it might be up in the air about whether The Death Trip drug is good or bad, there's no such debate needed about whether The Death Trip book is good or not - it's another great read.

539,539,"Pursuit of Glory, by Korey Mae Johnson, stands among the finest historical romances I have ever read. What could have come off as just another historical with a spanking on every page, Pursuit of Glory can easily pass as a mainstream historical romance without one single connection of hand, et al. to the heroine's bottom. That the spanking scenes are so seamlessly interwoven, making this book (as another reviewer said) a romance with spanking in it, rather than a spanking romance, thrills me no end!Renny escapes her father after he brutally chastises her for criticizing the king, and she stows away on Admiral Logan Liam's ship. At 18, she thinks she knows it all, and she happens to know a lot, having studied at her father's knee for many years. This is where Renny gets into most of her trouble, but in her we also see an aching need to be needed, and to garner the glory she thinks she deserves if only someone would give her the chance to prove herself. The author did a magnificent job in fleshing out the character of Renny so that each of us who were 18 once and wanted to be something to someone, can relate with aching clarity.The author also creates a sympathetic character in Logan Liam, a tough-minded old codger of immortal soul and little patience with Renny--until he finds himself falling hopelessly in love with her. Other minor characters add fuel to an already glowing fire, rather that act as filler, and all work in unison for the good of the story. There is not one false move in this book, including the bit of sci-fi element, which I found gutsy and creative.I would read anything by this author any day.

541,541,"Is a powerful story about bullying and the consequences that occur to the victims. This book was written because something haunted the author's core about the Columbine School killing. The killers' young teenagers themselves were displayed as evil monsters and not given any forgiveness for their horrific actions of injuring and killing innocent victims. This reader is neutral and not looking to debate with anyone about the terrible incident. This reader brought up this sensitive topic because this story is a warning and should be read and discuss with all silent crying out victims and the bullies to bring the truth to the light. Not all are innocent when a psychopath is created.This book was written to see the world through the victim's eyes and how he was affected by the constant taunting and teasing and the lies he experienced every day. School became a torture chamber and he tried to let the adults in his life know that he hatred every moment being in an institution and be bullied by mindless insensitive jerks. I as a mother and substitute teacher know the signs when a child becomes phobia and fights like a demon to not go to school; it is a plea for help. That the children are being destroy by cruel intents be it physically or psychological abuse by his peers and will do everything in their power to protect themselves and become strangers under your own roof to not experience one more hatred name or label. These taunts paint a self -image and the child starts to believe she/he are stupid, retarded and other vile labels.This author plotted a dark fantasy with criminal intent to get the message across that bully is the worst damage anyone could experience, it lingers long after the bully moves on with their lives and not realizing the aftermath of their intents. It is very graphic and my stomach almost came up with some of the details. This story is out there but with some of the bullies today this message needs to be declared. Reading this book will definitely open up many eyes and minds to the destruction of an innocent child that was forced to turn into a Dr. Hyde and JekyllIn the author's words; ""His heart felt blacker than night, empty, soulless, cold. Unfixable,bleeding, damaged to the optimal degree. There was no going back to any former life, any former sanity. This was the end of it all, the end of him. His cries were so loud, he could not hear the television. Muffy was standing by his feet, licking his pant leg to try and ease his anguish.""""I'm the bull's-eye in the sights of millions. Put me in a room with a million people, I'm the only target. They can sense it. Are there others like me? All this time, people are afraid of Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Ed Gein but are they mentally disturbed? Is that why they kill people? Are they crazy? How can they be?

544,544,"I confess it's difficult to convey in a few short words just how utterly bad this novel really is!The premise is certainly sound enough and, frankly, that's what prompted me to pick up this. The second coming of the Christian Messiah is at hand as a result of the deeply undercover cloning of Christ's DNA from blood recovered from the Shroud of Turin by a group of religious separatists known as the Vinces.THE SON OF MAN is clearly Christian fiction and one doesn't have to hunt very hard to see the clear parallels to the biblical story of the birth of God's son - the nativity star is represented by a rogue asteroid on a collision path with earth; the immaculate conception is presented via the impregnation of illegally cloned cells into a young virgin; the trek to Bethlehem is re-created as the struggle to reach Omaha, Nebraska, the anticipated ground zero of the collision with the asteroid; and the gift-bearing magi make an appearance as a kindly doctor and a Nobel Laureate physicist. There's even a John the Baptist character who ensures that nothing stands in the way of the birth of ""the Father's only begotten son"".I'll hand one kudo (and one kudo only) to CW Johnson. He definitely has the writing chops to create first rate suspense when it comes to describing the impending apocalypse that would be caused by collision of a mountainous asteroid with the heartland of America. Frankly, that's the only reason I actually finished this dog-eared mutt. But that's it! From a purely writing point of view, the plot is seriously disjointed and outrageously difficult to follow, sub-plots are willy-nilly injected and summarily dropped and the characters are cartoonish and thinly developed. Maria, for example, the stand-in for the mother of Christ on this second stab at converting the world, is a virgin only because she's a neurotic, egocentric,waspish whiner that no self-respecting man would stay with long enough to roll into bed.If one examines this novel from a thematic point of view, the theology is a joke and is an excellent example of the many reasons why I am a rabidly anti-Christian deist hanging tentatively by my fingernails on the edge of atheism. (And I know I'm not alone) That a self-centered, narcissistic God would make a second appearance to the world because we screwed up the receipt of his first message and failed to give him his due obeisance; that he would choose to make his appearance through the worldly efforts of a renegade group of arrogant theologians convinced that the end justifies their illegal means; that he would enlist a pederast, murderers, thugs, drug runners and extortionists as his advance earthly agents; that this so-called God would create havoc, mayhem, destruction, heartbreak, chaos and the foundation for a world-wide nuclear war as the climate for his second coming ... well, it's all more than laughable. It's the reason why there is so much antipathy today toward organized religion in general and Christianity in particular.If that's the God that Christian dogma has on offer, then give me the apocalypse but leave me alone after I'm dead and gone.

553,553,"I love old westerns, and I'm not too critical of them so long as they are well-written. Max Brand can write well, but there is a sameness to his word products. His heroes often tend to be introspective loners on the lam, and thus we get a strong psychological component. But, since Brand was paid by the word, there is also a tendancy toward wordiness; this, when combined with the aforementioned introspection, seems to prolong even the simplest actions.Brand wrote some good books; he was bound to writing so very much and in so many different genres. Indeed, many of his books (such as the Doctor Kildare series) are not westerns. But forced to churn out verbiage in magazine stories and short novels to make a living, too many of his tales seem perfunctory and more than a tad familiar, one to the next. And some plot devices are downright odd. That so many of hs books are as highly regarded as they are is certainly to his credit, but overall there is some hard-to-define quality (angst, perhaps?) about his western stories that doesn't particularly appeal to me; they somehow don't ring true. Nevertheless, for those who enjoy his stories, this set conveniently packages many of Brand's currently available public domain works.UPDATE 04-27-13: Wildside Press has just published a particularly well-formatted, 20-title ""Max Brand Megapack"" for only $.99.

554,554,"I thought this story line started out great but there was sort of strange behavior I thought on the part of the Heroine in the first confrontation in the first few pages.  Despite recovering from severe injuries, she felt she had to be the one to take charge.  Kind of silly I thought but maybe they wanted to establish how tough she was. However she repeated this behavior several times. From that point on, she always had to be the superwoman and I found it was very emasculating of supposed hero, her counterpart.  The confrontations continue and she continued to be the superwoman never giving the supposed male the chance to be at least her equal. In fact she had to be the one to rescue him several times and despite their partnership, she consistantly went around his instructions and just went a ahead and did what she felt like. I am only 2/3rds done with the book and it is all I can do to force myself to finish it. I normally love this author and unfortunately I bought both books in this series.

Wulf is the captain of a battle cruiser in the Prime military and Melina's mate(gemat for the male version). They of course meet and have an instant bond which Melina struggles against while they fight off several alien enemies and a home grown rebel force.I am not a professional writer by any means but I think my summary was more interesting then the whole book. It started out decent and then became the story of Melina constantly fighting and putting herself at risk which resulted in her getting hurt and then Wulf would show up after the fact to growl and rage and fuss over her....it was stupid. In one scene Melina is bleeding profusely, she can barely move, and a traitor shows himself in a room full of able bodied Prime warriors, but it's Melina who has to get up and fight the guy! All the warriors stand and watch, including Wulf, I was laughing it was so ridiculous. This was the theme throughout the book and the sci-fi elements came off as spouted nonsense. Here I can do it too, we are entering Helium Prime with four battle cruisers on our tail bearing 3.2 light years.......seriously!The author can put together a semi-decent sentence all though she would get names mixed up sometimes and you would have to stop to make sure who she was referring to, but the plot and storyline were awful after a third of the way through.

I have become so disgruntled lately with a lot of the junk that is out there. Needless to say, I am very happy that I purchased this book.The story was very good, though I have to admit all the fighting and life/death situations did become tiresome toward the end. The characters were very believable and Wulf was a HOT! HOT! HOT! Alpha male. Very possessive and protective and did I mention HOT? His growling did become ridiculous and I laughed at how often it was mentioned. Waaaay too much - though I like some growling.I really liked reading about a kick butt alpha female who wasn't about to fall into bed with the hero just because of biology and I loved it when she ran away from him forcing him to chase after her.  It was very entertaining and then, damn it, she decides to give in to him with no further effort on his part. I enjoy a story where the hero has to work HARD to secure his woman and sadly, this element seems to be missing in so many romances. There was some of that here but not near enough, in my opinion.Overall though, this was a great book by a talented author and I do recommend it.

When a blizzard closes the roads, Angeline (the girlfriend) gets stranded, and Alex's father never makes it.

Each chapter will focus on one, and only one, aspect of the novel. The chapters will be short because I do not have much time. I can only write in short bursts and I am easily bored.""Now, I have loved this stuff since the 60's, from William S. Burroughs on the left coast to Donald Barthelme in New York, by way of Texas.

If you find this kind of fiction at all agreeable, you should try some Lichtenberg.For what it's worth this seems a little bit old school, and I mean that in a good way. A lot of the current work is too showy and too cute-clever. A lot of it is navel gazing and lame, maybe even spineless. Lichtenberg's work has a little more muscle. Even as he playfully suggests, over and over, that you are in charge of the reading experience as the reader, he is actually in total control of what's going on and of what you are experiencing. You are being entertained, educated and manipulated. You are being experimented on, but it will feel good, (like a lab experiment that activates the pleasure centers of your brain.)But all of this is way too heavy. This is meant on at least some level to be fun and it is. There are some marvelous turns of phrase; some playful deception; a lot of joy and a bit of subtle aggression.

""Bonded by Need tells the sexy, erotic story of a trio of characters who simply can't keep their hands off each other. At least the men can't seem to keep their hands off Jayda. Jayda is a polymorphic shifter, which means she can transform from a human to a wolf or a cougar. She's recently moved to a new town and is now meant to marry the head of the wolf council.Jayda and the wolf council leader Cole are bonded together and destined to be married. The wolf part of Jayda is happy for the connection and Jayda hopes that all of her can be satisfied by the relationship with Cole. But her cougar side is crying out for someone else. That someone else just happens to be the head of the cougar council, Zane. Both men are obsessed with Jayda and can't seem to stay away but can either one actually satisfy her completely?Cole wants to be life mates with Jayda and believes that he is the only one for her. But Zane can't resist the seduction Jayda employs to try and get him for herself. Jayda wants both of the men but can she really have them both? Everything is starting to change as more and more people are killed and Jayda will need to make a choice before someone else ruins everything for good. But can she really choose between the two different sides of herself? And can she choose between the two men who both promise to satisfy her so well?This book is a great story about how one woman can be torn in more than one direction. I think Jayda is a character that nearly any woman could relate to since she seems like she's in a struggle between herself to choose which mate will be the best for her. This is a lot like just about any woman who is trying to make a choice that could prove to be incredibly important to her as time goes on. The two male characters are each hot and amazing in their own right and you'll be rooting for each of them by turns as they show their true colors and their true feelings for Jayda.This book is a great story about romance and love as well as involving some supernatural elements in the form of the shape shifters and the things they have to face in order to make their way through life.

He lives a good life as a Viscount and he's happily living in obscurity until he comes across a young lady of 15 years, walking to her death into the tide.  He rescues her, sends her off to a school for young ladies and then when she's 18 and beyond the legal reaches of her guardian, brings her home to live with him and his sister.  The only part of the story I didn't get was that there were a lot of rumors about the evil Baron, who raped Toria and how her father failed to notice these rumors or protect her from them and even made the Baron her legal guardian.  Even while trying to guard her reputation, it seems like the Viscount could have had enough information to have the Baron arrested for other reasons and safely jailed or executed or whatever.  But he manages to be a threat throughout the entire story and I think even if he had never been introduced into the story, he was definitely a villain in Toria's mind.There were some side characters that were interesting as well and it would be nice to see their stories as well.  Not deep literature, but definitely served it's purpose of entertainment and an escape from reality.",1,1,0.54954955,0.54954955,CA

597,597,"Let's start by saying that when I first started reading, I really thought I was going to get to read about a female character with some backbone for a change. Boy was I wrong. Oh, she acted like she had one, but immediately lost it the second he said something. Pathetic. I am really just sick of reading about women who cow down to a man because he knows how to get them off. After he makes all these apologies and you think they might make some headway, the bad guys break into the house and he locks her in a closet so he can keep her safe. Yet he know that she is an expert shot and he gives her a gun. And she saves his butt after breaking out of the closet. For a second you think she grew a backbone when she tells him that when it counted, he didn't keep his word, and tells him again to sign the divorce papers. He finally does, but now she can't go through with it, and goes back to him ready to apologize. For what? Sticking up for yourself? And I really wanted to scream when he handcuffs her to the bed and she asks ever hurt you?"" Um...he just drugged her a few hours before, and then handcuffed her to himself before handcuffing her to the headboard so he had both his hands to ""help her loosen up"". Yeah, I would call drugging someone hurting them. I don't care if it's because you're supposedly trying to protect them or not. Geez!And when she finally gets him to agree to let her handcuff him to the bed, she teases him for all of 30 seconds, because the lustful look in his eyes was just too much, before she caves and starts riding him. She can't even show strength in that!Author really needs a Thesaurus...The word Involuntary was just used too many times. It seemed like everything they did was `involuntary'. And seriously, these characters swallow A LOT! They were always swallowing. It seemed really stupid. Real people don't do this. If you do, then please see your doctor.Then we have ever present inconsistencies. One minute he's standing toe to toe with her, then he's taking steps towards her. Stuff like this is scattered all through-out the book. I have had this same issue with several of this authors books. She really needs to keep better notes while writing, and please, get a better editor. Missing or incorrect words really kill a story. Using words like hadn't instead of had really take a minute for the reader to correct on their own. If I have to stop reading to go back and try and figure out what word should have been there, we have a problem.The only reason I finished this book is because I cannot standing not finishing a book. I guess I really am trying to give the author a chance to redeem the book, but it just never happened with this one.",1,0,0.56185567,-0.109536083,CA

599,599,"For such a short story, Everything to Lose packed in quite a lot! Sean & Caitlyn are a married couple, yet things aren't going quite so well. Sean suggested they get a divorce & said some hurtful things to Caitlyn when things got rough. Without looking back, Caitlyn left and one year later, she is back in town for Sean to sign divorce papers yet Sean does not want to. He knew he made a mistake by letting his wife walk out of his life, but now he is determined to make her see that they're meant to be together & for her to stay permanently. But a killer from Sean's past comes back to complicate things and he'll do anything to keep her safe.Overall, I highly enjoyed Everything to Lose. For such a short story, I was surprised at how well-developed & fleshed out the characters were along with the plot and storyline. I'm a sucker for second chance romances & this one did not disappoint. However, I would have loved for an epilogue, but the ending still left a smile on my face.

They seem more animal than human. Bruno has to kill the current alpha in order to gain contol of the pack. To really seal they're bond, Bruno and Renee have sex in shifted form. Not all readers would want to read this and I'm surprised that isn't in the product description. Also a HUGE element that took some getting used to: ALL the females were referred to as bitches, which goes back to them seeming more animal than human.

601,601,"If you are quite like me and love all things talismanic, symbolic and/or esoteric, you will find this a worthy addition to your collection.The first part of the book is what I really consider the meat and potatoes - here, you will find pictures of the described talismans and some brief and thoroughly interesting dialogue on their known origins and meanings.  I found the Kindle version a bit cumbersome, though.  Even though the text is nicely linked to it's corresponding page of diagrams, once on the page of diagrams, it is up to the reader to navigate back to the referencing page of text.The second section of the book is devoted to astrology and a given sign's gem/s, notable sign characteristics, likely career endeavors, love matches, etc.  I found this section to be a disappointing departure from it's earlier material.  That said, it was somewhat interesting (though not new) and while I could surely argue it's inclusion, I find the whole thing would have gone off much more to my liking with the astrological section omitted.I knocked a star for the cumbersome nature of the Kindle version and for the awkward inclusion of astrological/zodiacal signs.  That said, I'm a fanatic of all things regarding symbology and have added the paperback version of this book to my wish list - I liked the early talismanic material enough that this book will be going into my permanent collection.",1,1,0.618320611,0.5706106870000001,CA
602,602,"I'm putting this review up because the other reviewers gave it two stars and I think it deserves more than that. I would rate it at about a 4.5.I have read most of Evangeline Anderson's works, and I have to say that this is one I've read several times. Evangeline does different types of stories, and this is one that is a bit heavier on the sci-fi than the erotica, although there is some hot sex (after all, the heroine IS ordering a sexbot!) :)I really like the setting and the heroine in this novel. It's about a girl running a mining station alone on the edge of space. In order to stay in business, she has to do all of the repair work on the smaller mining ships herself, and the last guy that she trusted stole just about everything she had, besides laughing her out of the bedroom. She only has a talking cat for company, who provides plenty of comic relief, but in the end, she's *lonely*. The heroine is not an over-the-top, dressed-to-impress hot blonde; she's an overworked, pragmatic, realistic heroine that has need of a decent man in her life.When she orders a Companion 2000 from an online catalog, what she ends up with isn't necessarily a decent man, but he ends up trying pretty hard to do the right thing by her...in addition to his sexbot duties. Watching the two characters sort out their individual obstacles and learn to care about each other was heartwarming, and I found myself actually wanting them to work it out in the end.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who is looking for sex almost every page, as with some of her other books. Instead, if you're looking for a solid story with good characters and great humor, this is the book for you.",1,1,0.549575071,0.624645893,CA

And i am very sure they will be doing some beast sex later. as long as you know what to expect. Its not the greatest book . i wanted to smack h sometimes but its free and a good length.

606,606,"(Originally posted on SnarkyMomReads)""FERAL DOMINATION"", by T. A. Day, is the first of (currently) four books of the Faldron Shifter series.  As of this writing, it is being offer as a freebie at Amazon.  Typically when I see something published by Ellora's Cave I jump on it; their writers are normally 'safe bets' and really - if it's free, what does it hurt to try out a new author?Um, famous last words.In the overall scheme of things, the storyline was very good & deserves about a 4.5 star rating.  Gionne and Jenna are childhood playmates that become sweethearts with plans to mate - even though he is lupine and she is feline.  (In other words - they want to see if cats & dogs CAN play well together...)  Due to his father's illness, Gionne pushes Jenna away and she is NOT understanding of this and turns her back on him.  Fast forward a few years and she is asked to be a ""guest"" at Gionne's compound while the lupines grant the felines some much needed land to hunt on.  This story has REALLY REALLY HOT sex scenes - menage & anal are some, so you are warned! - and lots of miscommunication due to some betrayals by one of the pack members.What this story doesn't have?  Descriptive communication.  At times I felt like I was reading stilted, Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator style dialogue.  It was driving me nuts.  (NOT - ""It was driving me nuts!"", she exclaimed emphatically.)  Like I said, though, this is the first of the series (published in 2009) and is over 300 pages.  I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that as the author got into the series, the dialogue flowed a bit more easily.Hey - it's a free trial right now.  Doesn't hurt to try, right?  And if you really like shifter romances - this could be the start of one of your favorite series!  YAY!",1,1,0.655440415,1.0,CA

609,609,"This is the book that ruined me for all ""average"" romance novel about lithe super fabulous women who looked like a million bucks and get the man of their dreams, yeah, like that's what the ideal woman looks like.After years of frustrating romance reading we have a burgeoning genre of BBW/Curvy romance authors that are striving to give the readers what we crave, a shred of realism amongst the fantasy... that not all women are size 0-10, and that a man can be just attracted to a ""curvy"" woman as he is to a reed thin super model.Fall From Troy is about a woman Angie who goes on a Cruise with her friend Corrie looking for romance, but what she comes to find out is she feels very out of place amongst the sexually liberated men and women on board the ship having the time of their lives in full view, she begins to compare her curvy body to the taut and tight bodies around her and feels insecure about how she looks.That is until she's spotted by Troy Hunter, he sees the curvy brunette hiding behind a potted plant and he can't take his eyes off her, when she makes her leave, he finds himself following her and let's just say that's where the heat really gets turned up.We have the classic formula of our couple not believing that this is anymore than a weekend tryst, Troy believes his future is with a blond, willowly beauty that will be the mother of his children but as time goes by feelings begin to emerge and Troy can't get Angie off his mind.While there were a few moments in this book that I could have done with out... I enjoyed this book so much that I've been on the hunt for every BBW romance ever since and I'm still going strong.Enjoyable book... very hot and heavy so if your not into explicit love scenes, then this book isn't for you.",1,1,0.536312849,0.536312849,CA

We see the sorcerous, Tabris, turn to the dark side, still blaming Ryson for her decisions. Most interesting in this volume is Inlo's ability to mix philosophy with a fascinating story. It was the most philosophical of the three books. I suspect, though, that without these discussions, Enin's inaction would be really frustrating. In the end, though, he finds his balance. Lief, Matthew, Enin and Ryson all met their fates - some went to their rewards in the afterlife, some continued on. It's a wonderful story. I'll miss these characters now that the trilogy is over.

615,615,"This book is slow. The pacing is slow, the action is slow, even the wording is slow. The author takes the stance that why use ten words to describe something when he can use thirty. This would not matter if the thirty words chosen invoked a sense of wonder or beauty, but instead they are simply as interesting as mashed peas.So, the basic premise of the book is that main character uncovers a ring under a mountain - I mean a sphere buried in the mountain. He meets with an wise elder named Gandalf - I mean Mappel - who tells him to gather a fellowship and meet in Rivendell - sorry Connel. Where they shall journey to the mountain and cast the sphere back into the fires - well destroy it after passing some tests. I am sure the story seems familiar, but I just cannot place where I read it before.All kidding aside this book is one dull read. I forced myself to get through it, but it was it was a difficult book to convince myself to pick up. The number of positive reviews may cause me to begin to read book 2 in the hopes that it improves.

So, let me just say that this is Rated M for Mature. The sex scenes sizzles and there are also moments of tenderness that makes this a good romance story.So, why only a 4 Star rating?

623,623,"I was in the mood for a vampire story and this novella fit the bill perfectly. On her way home from dropping her car at the garage after her hospital shift, Kristen is attacked by a rogue vampire. Her life changes overnight.&lt;&lt; It started with a little extra horniness. Everything male on two legs looked good to me. Even Gus, my seventy-year old neighbour, seemed to be more charming and attractive. >>She starts feeling ill and in desperation, seeks medical attention.&lt;&lt; ""Who bit me? Who did this to me?""""Don't you know?"" She gave me another pitying glance as she signed my release order. ""You've been bitten by a vampire. There is no antidote - no cure. In order to survive now, you need another bite."" >>She hasn't been turned into a vampire, but she needs one as her blood is now addicted. Through an anonymous hotline, she hooks up with random vampires across her city as a `donor'. They drink her blood, she gets her fix of venom and can cope for a few days more in her normal life. Then the night comes when she needs a fix - and the only available donor is the hot garage owner, Joe. She had no idea he was a vampire. He had no idea she was a donor.&lt;&lt; There was sympathy in his dark eyes but danger too. Like a starving carnivore suddenly faced with prey it knows it must not touch. ""I'm sorry you're in a bad way but I can't do this with you. I know you."" >>Unwilling for any kind of commitment, Joe makes a practice of only taking blood from strangers and is horrified at the prospect of becoming intimate with Kristen. He's been slowly falling in love with her for months - withouther having any idea - and now he feels guilty for what's happened to her.&lt;&lt; ""I knew there was a rogue loose in the area,"" he admitted at last, his deep voice rumbling with some private pain. ""Knew I ought to see you safely on that bus, but you seemed so damn sure of yourself. I thought you'd be okay."" He looked at me. ""I'm sorry."" >>Kristen has had few boyfriends and feels that her generous curves make her unattractive. Joe seems to think differently.&lt;&lt; Joe carried me as if I weighed no more than a feather pillow, which was both surprising and gratifying. Once your dress size gets into the double digits those Gone with the Wind-moments tend to get fewer and farther between, at least in my personal experience. But he wasn't even breaking a sweat. >>She's confused. He treats her so well.&lt;&lt; ""You all right?"" His deep voice was reluctantly gentle, as if I were a stray kitten he'd found out in the rain and was taking care of even though he really didn't want a cat. >>It's a confusing relationship. She needs his venom, he needs her blood. But there seems to be more to it, including the best sex she's ever had. And then suddenly, she has the chance of a cure. If they can find the rogue that bit her, there's a slim chance - a one-off - that she can go back to her old life and live normally again. Only if she does, Joe won't ever see her again. He'll go back to using strangers for blood and sex.&lt;&lt; What we had shared was something so intimate I would never have even considered doing it with a man I didn't care deeply for. To find out that he didn't feel the same way hurt in a way I couldn't even describe. >>Kristen slowly learns that what you want is sometimes not so obvious.&lt;&lt; If this was a twelve-step program I would be all the way to step twelve by now - whatever that was. Hell, I could be in a venom anonymous group standing up right now saying, ""Hello, my name is Kristen and I'm a venom addict but I'm four months clean.""

I read the books because I am fascinated with the dynamics of BDSM (in a voyeuristic/train wreck way) & because they are usually heavy on the erotica and light on the (sometimes) too saccharine romance. Rarely do I find a book that makes it all make perfect sense; that balances BDSM & romance without compromising either. Bound and Determined was so beautifully crafted that I could see that the Dom/sub characteristics of the characters were as intrinsic as their hair colour. The needs of the Dom, Owen were perfectly balanced by the needs of the sub, Sterling. This is a book that I will happily read again and again.",1,1,0.594771242,0.756862745,CA
629,629,"The book was sad most of the way through. No child should have to live in such surroundings. It has a way of showing how much children listen to the Mother and Father. People do not realize how much a child that is abused, takes on guilt from every one around them like every thing is their fault. So many things happened in his life that he had no control over. It was hard for him to sit and listen to gossip about his folks, when he knew the people talking were guilty of much worse. He had so much loss in his life,it seemed every one he loved or got close to died. He has a big heart and tried to live his life to be good to every one. Great read.",1,1,0.561643836,0.707762557,CA
630,630,"Whew! Where to start on this one?  First, I loved it so much, I downloaded it in the morning and I finished it by dinner time.  Its not a short book either!  Its just so good and a page turner.  O.k., I will try not to spoil this for you...Humor, there is a lot of humor in this book.  The two ""Human Slaves"" that belong to Maria, are a gay couple and are as crazy as some of my best gay friends, and who doesnt love a great gay guy, right?  These two are awesomely fun. Maria's verbal play with them is great as well. And, its just not limited to that.Drama, o.k., you gotta have some in order to make a book interesting right?  Just the right amount, really.  There is a really gruesome, nasty demon out there and Maria is out to get it!  She gets all her paranormal friends together plus a few humans and the hunt is on. There is also plenty of emotional drama between Justin (the sex object--whew!) and Maria as well. If you are a shifter fan, there are some shifters in this book as well, although not much.Sex, now this was a great book for that as well.  When Maria meets Justin, a hot  alpha male, who is a  former special forces soldier, all sparks fly and and lots of heat is given off.  I love, love, love, by the way, that the lead vampire in the story isnt a male. Oh, and what else gets mixed up? Maria's old boyfriend, who turned her and then dumped her, Luke, shows up too.I have to say, I found it absolutely hilarious that the herion is a very, very famous Maria...not gonna ruin that for you.The sex gets my rare 5 ice cube rating, as the sex is so sizzling you'll need them to cool down.Great read and a great price (on sale at the time I got it).",1,1,0.6138107420000001,0.5279909070000001,CA

I felt a little let down since after Kil's story (which so far a favorite) only because the stories that followed were a little too confusing and convoluting at the same time. But this book is quite different. Jek seems to be one of a kind when it comes to males from his planet. He's actually thoughtful, considerate and empathetic from the get go when it comes to his Sacred Mate. Brynda is also different as well.

639,639,"Reviewer SheilaLaurel sits in the coffee shop fighting her attraction to a man. Trying to avoid eye contact causes him to come to her table to drink coffee with her. When he sees that her book is the Bible, he tells her he is an atheist. Laurel decides not to argue with him but she also does not tell him she plans on becoming a nun. As their attraction grows, Julian feels Laurel may be the one for him in Dee Dawning's Sister Laurel and the Atheist. What will Julian do when he learns that Laurel is planning on giving her life to God? Will Laurel remain faithful to her choices made several years ago before being attracted to a man like Julian?I liked the premise of Sister Laurel and the Atheist. It was fun. I wanted to know why Laurel made her choice to go into the sisterhood. When I learned it was a promise made to God years ago when her father was ill, I wanted to know how she would keep her promise but acknowledge her attraction to Julian. Laurel did not make her choices lightly. There were times when I was not sure whether I would have my happily-ever-after in this story.I liked how Mr. Dawning took the point of view of each person as they were telling their part of the story. Sometimes we'd get the same story through two characters' eyes. It gave a fuller story so that I could understand each person's motive. I may not have always agreed with them but I knew that they had Laurel's best interests at heart.I liked Julian. While he may have started this relationship with a lie, he was a good person who knew that he had to tell the truth even if it hurt him. I liked both Laurel's and Julian's sisters. They were different but wanted only the best for their siblings. I felt the openness of the relationship between Laurel and her dad was wonderful. She could always rely on his strength and honesty. Sister Sue, Laurel's Mother Superior, was an angel. She was not about getting a woman into the sisterhood but what was best for each woman under her tutelage. She was very realistic about life, religion, and love--probably my most favorite character after Laurel and Julian.Sister Laurel and the Atheist is a delicious read that makes you remember your first love and your first time. There was more talking about sex and how it feels than there was sex in the story but I liked how open the talk was between Laurel and her sister and between Laurel and Sarah, who once dated Julian. It was good to see the support between them and the joy they felt in sex. Mr. Dawning has written a sex-positive story with wonderful characters who I would like to have in my life.",1,1,0.5646387829999999,0.709759189,CA

641,641,"This book is a pretty good read, I like the character Janis Stone and how she is not a stick figure like so many book and movie characters are. The book starts out with Janis trying on her wedding dress, which doesn't go so well because she is not quite small enough for the size she is trying to wear, but why she is even considering marrying this guy Gary only because he is her last chance is a little ridiculous. Yes she is thirty-nine but that doesn't mean she has to settle for someone so belittling. I love how a voice just suddenly appears over the speakers everywhere and the arrogant way Primus Taddus basically says they are needing wives so they are taking some just deal with it.Now the parts of the book that really didn't do it for me is how when Janis and the good doctor get together finally and she is trying to find out more about the aliens that have taken them she is just all over him. I'm sorry but if I had been taken by a bunch of aliens and being forced to marry one I would be asking so many questions they would probably take me back haha.The reason I gave this book 4 stars is because I love how Janis and Dr. Delos get together in the end after battling Primus Thaddus.

642,642,"I didn't finish this book, and that is incredibly rare for me. Like, I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book.Firstly, as a native Irish speaker, it kind of annoyed me to see Irish words thrown into this book. It just suggested a laziness to me. Using Irish words is fine if there's a reason for it, if your book features Irish legends, or characters, but this book has no ties to Ireland at all, so it was just a convenient way for the author to avoid having to create a language.Anyway, the reasons I didn't finish this;It's incredibly confusing. Most of the time I had no idea what was happening, but that was OK, because very little happened. I gave up a little over a quarter into the book, and the main character had been assigned to work as the doctor on a pleasure ship, had a few run-ins with the staff, and that's it.The main character has no redeeming features at all. She comes across as arrogant, holier-than-thou and self-important. She didn't entice me to keep reading at all.The main male character similarly, is flat and uninteresting. He used to be one of the most elite fighters in the universe, now he serves as the captain of a 'floating brothel' because his mother, the queen, is punishing him for refusing to marry. He is arrogant, rude, and while I'm sure he's stunningly attractive, there is no physical description of him, the ship, the universe. There is no world-building.This book is meant to be erotica, and to be fair, I gave up before there was a real sex scene, but I wasn't holding out much hope that they would be hot, given that two references to a man's penis were made, using the word 'dangly'.

646,646,"Posted on Romancing the Book's blogReviewed by AubreyReview Copy Provided by the PublisherI went into reading this book not really knowing what to expect. I really enjoyed it from beginning to end. I love for my erotica to not just be about sex but also have a back story and a bit of romance. For me, it makes it a lot more believable. The story of how Jared and Ninia get together is sweet yet sexy at the same time.Ninia is a strong woman who knows what she wants but also has the ability to give comfort to others in her profession as a nurse but especially in her romantic life. She lost her husband in the war and has not been with anyone since him. Jared is stubborn and feeling like his life is over after losing his leg in the war. He does not know what to do with himself now that he cannot be a soldier. Ninia is able to open Jared up enough that they start having feelings towards each other that go from lust to love.The erotic part of the story is super steaming hot. It may not be for everyone because it does have a strong BDSM storyline. Ninia and her husband were heavily involved in the BDSM lifestyle and frequented a dungeon. I was a little confused at first what a dungeon entailed but it was not what I pictured at all. Jared also went to various dungeons around the world. The story gets steamy when they meet up at a dungeon. Their sex is incredible but it is also where their love grows.I will be definitely buying the rest of the books in this series. I'm totally hooked to the secondary characters that have been set up for future novels. I read the book in one sitting and felt a great love for the characters. They were real and showed emotion that is often missing in some erotica.",1,1,0.5201149429999999,0.5201149429999999,CA

648,648,"In the year 3478, the Burning War has left Earth - or Terra as it's now known - a devastated, backward world that's lost three-quarters of its population to not only war, but to tsunamis, earthquakes, and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded. Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half. The people exist now in a futuristic ""old west"" in which the large cities and their machinery of old lay in ruin. In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall, black-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.During a three-month stay at the Citadel, Reaper Cyner Cree has paid penance for taking Aingeal as his mate and giving her one of his ""hellions,"" making her a Reaper without the Shadowlords' permission. The married couple return to their new home in Haines City, where the people have surprisingly welcomed them with open arms and are happy to hear that Aingeal is pregnant. But all is not well in Oklaks Territory.Two men the Reaper thought he'd killed - Otaktay, the Jakotai brave who still wants Aingeal back, and the Rogue Silus Gibbs - remain alive and pose a danger to them. However, they're not the only or even the worst threat facing the couple and the Territory Cyner has vowed to protect. The evil Ceannus have returned with more of their creations, rogues more dangerous than the ones that came before. And the Ceannus have let loose another danger, one Terrans cannot survive. One that could bring Cynyr and his fellow Reapers to their knees.WesternWind 2: Reaper's Revenge continues where WyndRiver Sinner left off. Although it can be read as a stand alone novel, I recommend reading the books in order for the most enjoyment; i.e. grasp of character development and the colorful ""MegaVerse"" that Charlotte Boyett-Compo has created for, not only this series, but for all her others. You'll get better acquainted with the other Reapers, the ""Texas Rangers"" of this new west, as they join Cyn to protect Haines City from the evil that threatens all of Terra. You'll also get more insight into the folks of Haines City, particularly the cheeky, outspoken Moira, who will have you in stitches as she and Aingeal lead the matchmaking efforts to bring together the Sheriff's daughter Danielle Brewster and the impervious Prime Reaper Arawn Gehdrin, who are the featured couple in book 3, Prime Reaper.Although I've always loved WyndRiver Sinner with a passion, this second installment to the series is an absolute thrill ride. Fast-paced and packed with absorbing action, the unexpected twists and turns will surprise and intrigue you from start to finish. The subplots keep the story rolling, and Ms. Boyett-Compo's sweeping descriptions will engross you. As always, her love scenes are as hot, as sweet and as smooth as melted butter. Add a touch of her light humor, and simply put, this book is thoroughly enjoyable.Even if you're not a futuristic cowpunk fan, this series offers other themes that will draw you in in a heartbeat.

659,659,"Reviewed by NadineTen years ago Ella Delacourte ran from her marriage.  The kink, the dominating and submitting, those were Jase's thing.  What started out as playful exploration turned much darker.  Her heart wasn't in it; not in the bedroom nor her marriage.  She knew what was coming next.  Knew Jase would bring in a third.  James Wyman was her husband's friend, employee, and the only man who could truly make her submit.  She was ashamed of her desires.  Afraid of her husband discovering her true passion.  So she ran and fought what was burning inside her.James knew how Ella felt about him; he felt the same.  He could see the desire in her eyes.  He knew she was it.  James thought he'd give her time to come to him.  Ten years is a long time to wait and James' patience just ran out.Trying to repair the damage she caused in her relationship with her daughter, Tess, Ella moves back to Virginia to be closer to her.  As a favor to Tess, Ella allows James to stay in her home while his housing is being situated.  After all these years she's been plagued with fantasies of him.  But, she has worked hard at controlling her desires.  She can put up with him for a short time.  She can resist.  James on the other hand has grown tired of Ella's self control.  It's about time she let the walls down, let him show her the pleasure she's needing and has been fighting for so long.  It's time for her to become his.Submission is book 2 in the Bound Hearts series.  We met Ella in the previous story.  She came off as being a complete prude in Surrender.  Who knew there was a naughty girl hiding inside her.  She just needed someone man enough to draw it out.  She needed James Wyman.  Ella is putty is James' hands.

I mean, at one point he heads off to do something and then the story is ""summed up"" and this guy is just never heard from again.All that being said, I liked what was attempted.  I enjoyed the new sci-fi world that I was brought into and it was a good story mixed in with all the sex...I just wish there was a little more to it.",1,1,0.522058824,1.0,CA
664,664,"I decided to read this book because it was free and I had read a few things by Lora Leigh before. I had never read her bound hearts before and have no desire to read another. :Spoiler: Tess had a call from her father asking her if she was coming to his party she had not been to one in over a year.She agreed to come for a week.Her mother and father were divorced she could not deal with his kinky life style.He is married to a dumb blond only ten years older than Tess and she did not like her. She has a thing for her brother he had told her two years ago all the sexual things he would like to do to her . She had not seen him since. She had read books when she was in college that her mother called her a pervert so this is the reason of the story. She hears from Cole asking her about the party while she is pleasuring her self.  she has not  heard from him in two years.She goes to her father's he and Missy are not there.They are supposed to come back the next day except Cole comes. You find out her father has gotten Cole to teach her how to be submissive .She wakes up the next day tied down and spread eagle. He tells her she can say no but he never stops if she asks. He brings in another man who works for her father as well as Cole.For a threesome.So far no love or foreplay its what Cole wants. While the three are in bed in walks her mother screaming pervert, than her father and step mother. The other man leaves says he is not involed . So what does Tess do go into the kitchen with her hated step mother and eat ice cream. They are friends now and Cole has disappeared. I will leave the ending off did not seem real to me. I could not get over her father setting her up , plus the other man there was no romance what so ever. I do not like the bondage story but can deal with it if maybe you tie each other up for fun once in a blue moon.I do not see how someone else can tell you what you like . I think they should have the devil beat out of them for a change and see if they feel pain. There was no heavy stuff in this the only thing I can say good about it.

I didn't like the book because:-Tess is tricked and lied to by her father to come to visit him and his second wife for 1 week.-When she gets there he and his wife are not there.-She thinks he will be arriving back from a trip but the next morning she wakes up tied to the bed by Cole who is nude.-She tells him to untie her and let her go but we all know what his answer is going to be and because Cole has loved her for 2 years and she turned him down he is going to force her into admitting her kink one way or the other.-He tells her that her father set her up because he knows what she really wants in her heart because when she was younger  her parents found some of her erotic novels on dominance and submission. So what about it? Just because she was reading that didn't mean she was wanting to be a willing participant.-So her father is leaving her alone and at the mercy of his brother-in-law for 1 week to get her to admit her kink. Her father is divorced from Tess' mother because he is also into kink. This means that he discussed Tess' private business with his second wife and his brother-in-law.-There is a menage scene with Tess, Cole and a stranger to her who also happens to be Cole's best friend and the second in command at her father's business. She doesn't care about him and he doesn't care about her either. EEWWWWWhat a turn off! Her father's betrayal and there is nothing else you can call it along with the menage between 3 people, 2 of which didn't give a fig for each other ruined the book for me.",1,0,0.48224852100000004,0.073964497,CA
666,666,"I love Lora Leigh and have read most of her books and love them.  I have all her black op books and some of this series the bound hearts.  I have not read Surrender, so when I saw it was free was very excited.  I was very disappointed for a Lora Leigh book.  She normally has a great story line along with the hot sex in her books.  This book was mostly all sex, like other reviewers have said.  I did not like either one of the characters at all.  I did not feel the connection and love Cole & Tessa had that was suppose to be there from the beginning, it just lacked in so many ways.The sex was good, lots of BDSM but I thought a little poorly written.  I read a lot of this type of book so didn't see anything wrong with Cole tying Tess to the bed naked while she slept and ""forcing"" the sex to start when she awoke.  I have read a lot of Lora Leigh to know the sex in her books are out of the box and need people with a really open mind to read (I loved her Men of August series but got it lot of negative reviews).  The thing that I found the most wrong was Cole never had Tess pick a safe word.  When you have sexual situation where Cole is pushing and testing Tess's limits, like he explains to her, its pretty important to have a safe word, especially since he didn't listen to her saying NO, which is why you have a safe word.There was little storyline, not much keeping me to read to the ending, just lots of sex and the menage at the end.

672,672,"I requested this book from Rebecca Forster, the author, because I loved her novel, Hostile Witness, and she was kind enough to oblige. I give this novel 3.5 stars.Before Her Eyes focuses on two protagonists, Dove, a hard-boiled small town policeman, and Tessa, the beautiful model that has vanished. The setup is interesting--there is a dead man in a convenience store, which is the last place Tessa was seen before she vanished. We see alternating perspectives between Dove in a tight third person, and Tessa in first person. As Dove tries to track down Tessa, he finds himself uncovering mysteries that others hoped to keep hidden.The strengths of this novel include some of the great description and some interesting plot twists. Forster excels at revealing secrets and bringing the unexpected.However, I had some difficulties with this novel. The pacing is a little off-- I found myself uncertain why we were following Tessa at all. The middle drags some as we wander around with Dove trying to figure out what is going on. And although I really enjoyed the twists, particularly at the end, some of them still don't quite make sense to me.That said, I still think Forster is one to watch-- and her Witness series is excellent.

677,677,"I'm so happy that I ventured beyond the first ten results and discovered this hidden gem.  I have already re-read some of my favorite parts of this love story at least three times, and am considering starting from the beginning to re-live the heart-twisting tale all over again.  I loved reading about Ricky and Carolyn's awkward, and sometimes frustrating and belly-warming, courtship.  Never have I been introduced to two characters who were hit by love at first sight and were absolutely clueless as to what to do with the blessing of finding a perfect match so suddenly and unexpectedly.  As a quick spoiler...both of them ruin it - several times - but they are so unconsciously in love with each other that neither of them can stand to be separated for too long before one comes seeking the other, like two lost, doe-eyed puppies.Ricky is an *ultra-urbanized* white underground rapper who can't seem to get a break into mainstream, probably more due to his skin color than his undeniable lyricism (PS - I'm amazed by the author's writing skills for creating some of the rhymes and quick-paced lines for the rap battle and also sprinkled through the story. Wow.).  Carolyn is a mixed race newly discovered author whose main difficulty is trusting her own heart.  Both of them have been touched by heartache, Ricky more so - his back stories are touching, adds a hidden layer to the hard exterior he feels it necessary to wear, and gives a greater depth to this unique romance hero - yes, he does play a hero - a roughneck one at times, but he can't seem to think of Carolyn as anything other than his woman, even from that very first day.  The best part about this story is that Ricky doesn't think  he's chasing Carolyn's heart, but he is, and at a sprinting pace like a man running across the desert for fresh oasis he spots in the distance.  And Carolyn thinks she fleeing from Ricky, but not really, and if she does give an effort to throw a half wall up between them, she knocks it done with her bare hands and raspy breath within the next few minutes right after.At first, the story was difficult to sync into, then I realized that I had to shed some pretty lousy thinking on my part - due, in part, to lessons learned from some of the stock of IR contemporary romances that I had previously read (most of which I never bothered rating, because they didn't deserve the time or effort).  I had to shed the notion of a ""white knight"" - the rich Caucasion male, confident, powerful, overly articulate, who would ride up in his limo, flash some cash and a perfect smile and make all the desperate heroine's problems go away. She, of course,  should then feel overly-honored that he had given her the time of day and suddenly realize how wonderful, exotic, and desirable her ethnicity is - even if she is already a confident, successful, beautiful, and educated woman, the writer must make sure we, the audience, realize this is one of her many reasons for breaking her own rules and dating a white man. None of that happens in this story - Thank God!  The touches on race are quick and have nothing to do with self-discovery.  Carolyn and Ricky know who they are and how people from both of their inner and outer circles see them.  Also, I quickly realized that the author is writing in a style that is more natural to how people interact - the dialogue and inner thoughts are broken and choppy - but this is a brilliant risk and works to her advantage.  Most people don't speak or think in long full sentences - to themselves or others.  Falling in love and losing yourself to another person can be scary, and this realistic writing style helped me to envision Rick and Carolyn as two real people, and a true-to-life couple, struggling with the fear of giving in to their undeniable love and attraction for each other, not as two flat characters on a page reciting chunks of cliche dialogue back and forth across a room.As I said, very unique story line, refreshing presentation, and a wonderful emotional roller-coaster make this a great contemporary romance.  One that this genre is sorely in need of.  Cheers to the author...I do hope that she will right more (PPS...I liked the new-take on the Epilogue style, but I would have absolutely loved one more parting scene with Ricky smiling at Carolyn and her getting all heated when he gets too close!)Grade A.

That might be true in this case too, but I'm going to say it anyway... this book is one of the best I have read in AGES!  It is so fresh, and true to life!  The characters are so real they just jump right out of the book and into your spirit.  When they feel sad, YOU feel sad, when they're happy, YOU feel happy, and for an Author to be able to do that, in my opinion is the mark of a truly gifted author.The author has created these amazing characters that you will find yourself so caught up in what they're going to do next, you won't want to put the book down.  I know I didn't.  I struggle daily trying to find something that teenagers will actually read.  They will read this.

Not to mention Rick's dialogue was very distracting and I found myself having to re-read most of what he said in order to understand and/or relate to the conversations they were having.Another point I agree with was there was no indication of flashbacks as they occurred frequently throughout the story.

The rapper was extremely difficult to understand speech wise, probably because I didn't have an ebonics dictionary right next to me.  The woman seemed to waffle back and forth about seeing this guy, and there seemed to be little or no history built into these characters in that short time frame of the book. Perhaps further along in the book, there is some insight as to why these two people act the way they do, but not being able to understand the speech patterns or methodology of these people made it too difficult for me to be able to care enough to get to that point.

692,692,"In the year 3478, the Burning War has left Earth - or Terra as it's now known - a devastated, backward world that's lost three-quarters of its population to not only war, but to tsunamis, earthquakes, and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded. Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half. The people exist now in a futuristic ""old west"" in which the large cities and their machinery of old lie in ruin. In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall, black-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.As a result of the torture and maiming he endured during his last mission, Reaper Owen Tohre has taken a leave of absence from his duties. But he isn't coming to terms like he'd hoped with the man he is now, one that may not be able to function sexually as a man ever again. To deal with his nightmares and inability to sleep, he's abusing Tenerse, the powerful drug all Reapers must take daily to keep from transitioning out of cycle into their wolf form. As a result of his drug abuse, Owen is blacking out and hallucinating. And he's too weak to saddle his own horse.Delirious, he finds himself riding near the international border between the Wismin Territory of Serenia and the Manontaque Province of the Northmen Cadre when he hears a young boy yelling for help. It's second nature for Owen to respond, but after pulling the child from a lake, he goes into seizures so violent he nearly dies. When he awakens in a strange place inhabited by a strict Communalist Colony of stern, abusive men and their subservient women, he finds himself acting rude and sexually aggressive with his lovely violet-eyed nurse - altogether out of character for the well-mannered Owen.Rachel Lawrence has never met a man like the Reaper, a man who speaks frankly of his sexual desire for her. Ashamed of the fact, she realizes she wants him too. Against the backdrop of evil Drocht&aacute;irs killing the Colony's people and then raising them from the dead to terrorize the living, the news of what Owen and Rachel have done together in the seclusion of his sick room reaches the ears of High Elder Chamberlain. Behind Owen's back, Rachel is punished and cast out of the Colony...literally dead to them all. What the elders don't count on is Owen's love for Rachel, his mate, and his determination to save her. Unfortunately, what he must barter away to save her life will plague the couple for all their time together.Of all Charlotte Boyett-Compo's Reaper series, the exciting and emotionally stirring WesternWind series is one of my top two favorites. The combination of the futuristic flavor mixed with old west (gunslingers dressed all in black with laser whips and six-shooters) and paranormal (vampire, werewolf) elements truly makes for fascinating tales. Tears of the Reaper, book four in the series, is my absolute series favorite, with book one, WyndRiver Sinner coming in a close second. Though all the books in the series have a dark fantasy flavor, Tears of the Reaper has a number of disturbing scenes of violence against Rachel that tear the heart out and will make you mad as hell, so be prepared. As always, the sex scenes are sensual, creating a loving connection between Rachel and Owen. The secondary characters, most having been seen in the previous three books, are as three-dimensional as ever.This book also displays Ms. Boyett-Compo's unique ability to present both the strengths and weaknesses of her characters. Everyone who's read the series know what awful thing happened to Owen in book 3, Prime Reaper. As a result, he's experiencing what we know as PTSD. He's in considerable emotional pain and finding his memories of his torture too difficult to live with without the numbing aid of more and more Tenerse, until he finds himself suffering the effects of Tenerse poisoning. His story is harrowing and poignant, and even as he recovers from his poisoning, life continues to hand him one emotionally painful consequence after another. But through it all, he finds a love so strong, it makes the pain and what he has to give up to save Rachel bearable and worthwhile.Although this book can stand alone, I highly recommend reading this series in order. As each Reaper's character building continues from book to book, much of Owen's back story can be found in Prime Reaper. Likewise, much of Ms. Boyett-Compo's underlying world building is better understood as she builds upon it throughout her highly imaginative story arc. -- This review belongs in its entirety to TwoLips Reviews.",1,1,0.601083032,0.7783794620000001,CA
693,693,"Virgin Seeks Bad-Ass Boy is hot, hot, hot! I read it while on the exercise bike at the gym. The hotter it got, the faster I pedaled. Ms. Kerce has a talent for writing emotion-packed stories. Alice is charming and sweet and anxious to lose her virgiity. Caleb starts off as the classic bad boy, but Ms. Kerce shows us his tender side which makes this story so sweet while it was incredibly hot. The sex was Wow! but it was the emotion between the characters that really makes this story. It's a hot, beautiful love story. I highly recommend it.",1,1,0.666666667,0.712962963,CA

Caleb is the guy across the street who seems to have a parade of women going in and out of his house.  Ali decides she doesn't want to be a virgin anymore so she walks up to Caleb, while he is working on his motorcycle, and asks him if he'd like to help her out of her dilemma. I know that sounds a little far fetched but what fun and excitement. She doesn't even know him except by sight.

696,696,"I wrote an earlier review but was  not allowed to send it, because I went into detail as to why I did not like the book and used examples from the book as to why.  Naturally this book is described as Erotic Romance and those examples were not appropriate.First off, this book is not romantic and it certainly was not steamy.  I saw no romance in this book until the very last few pages.  Other than that, the hero was strictly Master and seemed to take pleasure in the punishment.  He was not protective of her in that he made her ""get into position"", and a position that was very revealing for all to see her finer qualities who might be visiting and were allowed to touch wherever they wished while he watched.  It reminded me of the Story of O.  The entire book was focused on one aspect of her anatomy, and I hint at it in the title of this Review. There was no pleasure to pull you into the book to feel what she felt and to go ""OMG"" at steamy scenes such as books from Vivien Sparx.I have read much better Master/Submissive books wherein the Master was kind and considerate and eventually one could see something growing between the two such as love.  These Masters did not like the idea of someone else looking at her finer qualities let alone touch.  When I see the word ""romance"", I expect to see exactly that and/or something growing between the hero and heroine as the two work together in that sort of relationship. I did not see this in this book.I forced myself to read to the end hoping that it would get better.  It only got worse and to me, degrading.

When I bought the book the ratings were excellent, but now when I go back to see why on earth I ever got it, I find that in the meantime several one-star ratings have appeared, most of which I totally agree with.Already chapter 1 had me wondering, it was a totally uninteresting account of an office day, but then I was hooked by the last sentence - the main charachter was in fact a prison inmate - and I went on, thinking things would develop from there. But they never did - it was followed by equally boring detailed accounts of chemistry experiments, fishing trips, teenage partying and dating and other events that seemed totally unrelated and irrelevant.Maybe it all somehow is tied together in the end, but when the story still hadn't taken off att 28% I gave it up.The editing was also very bad with grammatical errors and typos.",1,0,0.617021277,0.38297872299999997,CA

701,701,"I picked this up yesterday for free and stayed up all night reading it.  It was an awesome, very erotic read!Grace moves back to her old town where she inherited a guest home from her dead husband.  Unfortunately, her step son, who older than she is, lives in the main house on the same property.  He believes that she had an affair with another man while married to his father, and said man, killed his father--shot him during an argument.  He blames her for his father's death, but doesn't know the true circumstances of why Grace agreed to marry his father (she was only seventeen at the time) or why the man shot his father.  What he does know is that ever since he saw her as a teen, he's been in love with her.  And he hates her and himself for his strong feelings toward this woman.Grace also is attracted to Trick, but she believes he hates her and blames her for his father's death.  From the moment she moves back, she is torn between lusting after him and trying to keep her distance.  Soon, Trick realizes she's also brought her adolescent son (who he believes is his brother) and he wants to spend time with him.  So it becomes difficult for them to maintain their distance.The chemistry between Grace and Trick is so strong - both lead characters are trying to resolve their feelings of distrust, love, lust.  The love scenes are unbelievably hot.  And the thing is that the reader doesn't find out what is going to happen until the very end of the book.  Let's just say Ms. Grace is holding out some on secrets that are game changers.This is a really great erotic read! Highly recommended!!!",1,1,0.558208955,0.646567164,CA

703,703,"In my opinion the cover of this book is horrible and belies its quality. It made me think it should have been the cover of an 80's porn movie.  I feared the cheesy cover and free price were telltale signs of low quality story telling.  Even though my first impression told me to stay away from it, I ""purchased"" the book anyway based on the reviews.  It was free and if I didn't like it, I wouldn't read it - no harm no foul. Much to my surprise, the book was well written, had good character development, and the story was creative as well as capturing.  The book was definitely steamy and the intense sex scenes carried on for pages and pages.When I finished the book I felt a bit lost as I had become engrossed in the characters and the story kept replaying in my mind (which to me is the sign of a good book).  Since I couldn't stop thinking about the story, I read it again, the next day.  I have since done a little more homework and found Beth Kery has many books out there, almost all with reviews in the 4-5 range.  I am now reading my second Beth Kery book and am excited to see a new story line that promises to deliver a similar impact as this book did.*For those of you with issues regarding editing: this book has some editing issues.

The male and female leads (I cannot bring myself to call them main characters) were not at all sympathetic or attractive.  No character development.  Nothing. Just crude sex.  No matter what I pay for a book, by darn, I finish it!  Not this one.  It is absolute disgusting trash.  When things headed for anal sex, I ""closed"" the book and deleted it.  Filth.

706,706,"This book is wrong on so many levels and although I don't usually type spoilers I will for this one..Hope is the daughter of one of the scientists at the lab Wolfe is held at. Although he marks her, he refuses to mate her because of her age. The labs burn down and Wolfe is believed dead for  years. Hope is alone and unable to move on with another man because of the bond.Hope's evil mother apparently knows Wolfe survived because she has been sending him photos of Hope with other men. (Fake of course). Wolfe appears out of nowhere, captures Hope, and punishes her by teasing her with sex, and not allowing orgasms. Due to the mating heat she is apparently writhing in pain while he continues to try getting the answers he seeks.If you find nothing wrong with the above, it gets worse!First time for her and he sticks it in her ass.When he finally out of no where does a 180 and decides she is innocent, he doesn't want to to relieve her because he might be to rough and his animal is at the surface!? What?!Of course she begs, they have their orgasms, and all is forgiven. There's some joking.

707,707,"In the year 3478, the Burning War has left Earth - or Terra as it's now known - a devastated, backward world that's lost three-quarters of its population to not only war, but to tsunamis, earthquakes, and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded. Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half.  Te people exist now in a futuristic ""old west"" in which the large cities and their machinery of old lay in ruin. In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall, black-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.Assigned to the Oklaks Territory, Reaper Cynyr Cree is hot, tired, dusty and not in a good mood when he rides into the broken-down town of Dyersville, seeking to execute a Rogue by the name of Casper Hul. When he interrupts a man in an alley, attempting to rape a young woman, he slays the scoundrel with a deft flick of his laser whip. The last thing he expects of the young woman is her to follow him to his camp in search of food and protection.Wed in an arranged marriage to a rancher who traded her to a Jakotai brave for two horses, Aingeal knows the true meaning of hardship and toil. After becoming the property of Otaktay and he shared her with his friends, she ran away, knowing that if the brave ever caught her, he'd kill her. She'll do whatever it takes to stay with the handsome Reaper, whose very soul seems to call out to hers in the most seductive of ways.Cyn has never experienced the need to keep any woman around after she's pleasured him, let alone want one to stay and share his life. Living on the move, always keeping his distance from fearful humans; such is Cynyr's solitary lifestyle. He hs no business wanting to mate and settle down with the dirty, bedraggled woman to whom he's promised his protection. Like wolves, Reapers mate for life, and once mated, there's no turning back - especially when Cyn makes a choice that so goes against Council law he can only pray the Shadowlords won't take Aingeal away from him forever.As an author, it's no secret that Charlotte Boyett-Compo is one of a kind, an original. Her stories are filled with descriptive adjectives and heart-rending emotion.  Her characterizations, plots and world-building are singularly unique and captivating, her prose smooth and evocative. Before Cowpunk had a name, Ms. Boyett-Compo was writing it. Between the covers of WyndRiver Sinner, you'll find a book that combines Sci-Fi with the Old West, magic with a vampire/werewolf paranormal, all with a touch of Fantasy. And like all of Ms. Boyett-Compo's novels, you'll find Celtic lore and imagery, along with a reverence for the wind, woven throughout Aingeal and Cynyr's story.Astounded that Aingeal loves him, Cyn's desire for her and his tender possessiveness toward her is driven by much deeper feelings than mere lust. Sweet and beautiful but tough as sun-baked leather, Aingeal easily accepts Cyn's dreaded Reaper nature, making him see past all the horror of what he thinks he is to the good, honorable man he really is. Her insight into his inner turmoil stirs her emotional need to soothe his pain.  It pulls at the reader's heartstrings, even as it moves Cyn to the realization that he wants to take her as his mate...and keep her forever.If you're looking for mere escapism, just about any book will do. But if you want an emotionally touching read that you won't soon forget, this is definitely the book for you. -- This review is owned in its entirety by TwoLips Reviews, LLC.",1,1,0.593073593,0.445100354,CA

I dislike giving 1 star reviews and I am the first to admit that I may be more picky that most, and I don't want to take away from the author's hard work by tearing her book apart, but I do feel I should explain why I stopped reading after chapter 2.Through most of the first chapter it was hard to tell if the writer was writing in first person or third person.  I love fantasy, paranormal, and science fiction...a lot! But, chains that pop out of your body to tell who your life mate is, well, seems beyond weird and a little gross.  But the clencher was the sex scene in chapter 2.  It was rape.  She said no, period.  I have a hard time with ""erotica"" that passes off rape as sensual and enjoyable.So, there you have it.

(So what else is new?)In any event, I enjoyed this tale as I found it fairly well written with a decent story line, one which kept my attention.  It had good character development as well as the ability to transport me into the world the author created.  I really don't see why the reviewers of this book had such harsh, critical comments...after all, it's not like they didn't know they were downloading a Sci/fi with sex as the main ingredient, right?  I found the ""chains"" aspect to be an appealing one because  when the two bodies accept each others chains it is proof that you have found your soul mate.  Kind of a refreshing idea in our world of today, where marriage and relationships are pretty much ""throw away"".Look, this book will most likely not win any awards for great literary fiction in the Sci/fi category; but as stories like this one go, it was certainly not the worst thing I have read--and as a relatively quick diversion, it told a story about the empowerment of women which was ""out of this world"" (so to speak).

I was a little worried, having read the 2 star review, but I figured the several five star reviews outweighed it.I wish I'd listened to the 2 star reviewer (who I think was a little nicer than she should have been).This book was awful. Horrible. Disgusting. Upsetting. I cannot find a single redeeming factor to the entire thing.  Here's why I hated it, why I'm fired up about reviewing it, and why I will never, ever, never, ever again read anything by this author.- The h is meek, mild, picked on, mistreated - and she just keeps going back for more. Over and over again, people, including the H, are downright cruel to her. I expected there to be some discovery or journey that leads the h to believe that she is worthwhile and has grown from the experiences she's lived through. That never happens. The book ends and she's still feeling sorry for herself and her life is utter crap.- The H is a complete jerk. He never redeems himself, and he never even makes a full effort to redeem himself. He sleeps with his WIFE after sleeping with the h, then repeatedly chooses his wife again and again (a woman who is cruel and insane) over the h. He simply tells the h 'sorry' and she instantly forgives him and the go on their merry way until the wife comes back a few pages later and the H runs to her.- There is very little lead up to the resolution (and it's a half resolution at that). The h ends up with a man, but it feels like she's more ending up with whatever leftovers are there, than that she's getting a HEA.- The h never stands up for herself and in fact, never even addresses some serious betrayals by her best friend/roommate, who told all of her private information to the crazy stalker wife of the H.It sickens me that I paid good money for this book. I finished only because I kept hoping that it would somehow get better. It makes me leery to try new authors when this is the kind of utter crap that I end up with.

725,725,"Karen Anderson's note really should say it all. While Amazon apparently doesn't want the details of the copyright dispute to be included in reviews, they can be discovered easily through Google-- query Poul Anderson, copyright dispute, and Project Gutenberg.Simple decency says that, when an author's widow is dependent on the authorized sale of his works for her livelihood, we shouldn't be sending our money to for-profit publishers who aren't paying the family their royalties.This isn't merely a case of disputed legal opinions regarding arcane copyright laws. This is a real flesh-and-blood human being, the woman Poul Anderson loved and to whom he was married for some 48 years, who is being damaged. The only ethical response we as readers of Anderson's work should have is to endeavor to do what we think he would have wanted regarding his work.

This novella is lighter on the story-side of things than the first book. I was a little disappointed because the plot is intriguing but this tale is still a nice, light read. Primal Attraction will get you turned on and you'll stay that way until the end!Sorcha and Cale are reunited after nearly a century apart. Cale thought she was dead and she doesn't remember him. Quite the pickle! You can probably guess how such an encounter would play out... Cale can't believe his eyes while Sorcha is mystified as to why this cat shifter is all up in her personal space. To make things even worse, Sorcha is a huntress and her current target is Cale. While he's trying to jump her bones she's trying to kill him. Talk about mixed messages!My favorite element in this novella is the primal ""mate"" instinct that drives the two main characters. The hopeless romantic in me wants to believe that we all have a special someone who we're destined to be with. That their pull is stronger than gravity. Cale and Sorcha's relationship illustrates this theory to a tee. Even though her mind doesn't know him, her body recognizes him. Kinda corny but it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.When Cale and Sorcha aren't going at it between the sheets there's still a decent amount of action unfolding. Even though most of the fights seem to end in bed. There's an alley encounter that's particularly toe curling. I highly recommend it! On the downside, I thought Sorcha wasn't the best name choice. I had a hard time getting past it and as a result wasn't a big fan of her as a character. Shallow much? Maybe.Primal Attraction wasn't as good as the first installment but still a nice diversion. This novella is great if you want a small vacation from reality. The sexual escapades are delicious. If your man's idea of foreplay falls short, try reading this first!",1,1,0.623152709,0.773891625,CA

733,733,"If you had picked up Mr. Sargent's ""Seven Days from Sunday"" at the airport on the way to your summer vacation, it would be a very good read for $8.  For $1 it is a must.  It has an interesting locale (the markets, homes, farms, and Green Zone of Iraq), a suitable cast of heroic CIA operators, and pace provided by an exciting countdown to a threatened attack.  OK, the latter isn't exactly new, but it works.  I can find little to fault, to be honest, but I did have a sense that the special unit known as MP-5 was on a very, very long leash from Langley.  Given the nature of the threat, it seemed there were surprisingly few occasions when headquarters wanted to be informed in real time.  A very different picture from that painted in, for instance, the Bourne series, and one that I suspect is rarely found in the real world.  But what do I know?

First we have Kasie who was written as a woman firm in making sure she was no longer going to be controlled and manipulated and she is kidnapped by her former fianc&eacute;e. She does not know it's him at first and does nothing but allow herself be thrown into a car with a hat over her head and tied at her neck and she makes no effort to yell, fight and get away! What an insult to women! Then she finds out it's Chay and she does nothing still? Please! She hasn't seen or spoken to this man in eight years! She makes no effort to get away when they stop at a hotel, no effort when they are at the store later, just complaining to the store owner she's been taken against her will, but let's the store owner dismiss it! And all the time in the cabin she complains but let's him get away with speaking to her with attitude when he is the one in the absolute wrong and acts like she doesn't have the right to be upset and mad. Hello?! He committed a federal offense! Not even to mention that he committed a wrong to her. And no one so much as tells him how wrong he is, just is like oh, it he's a good guy and they're sure her dad has his reasons? Pahlease! The story lacked true character and depth. It fell too short of reality. Yes it's a work of fiction, but it still needs to make sense and it is a story of real people, not an alternate world or paranormal scenario. Tis was not a well written book. Thankfully this was a free read. I would have been unhappier if I wasted money on top of time. Free doesn't mean it has to be crap writing.",1,0,0.548812665,0.0,CA

741,741,"The writing is almost juvenile and stilted in style. There are no contractions and the editing leaves much to be desired. The plot is almost nonexistent. The characters are hardly believable. Event the prologue begins with the actual story, not in the past when Kasie overheard the conversation between Amory and her father. That would have set the story up. I mean, come on, who says being a tomboy means you can't be a real woman, which is what is intimated in this novel. Or that women have certain work they should be doing and men have other work and neither the twain shall meet? She actually used the term woman's work! What is with the whole virtue thing also? I men, if my father asked me if I had been violated at age 24, I would have told him to mind his own business. She's been engaged twice but is still has not been violated? Who says that? At least make it a life style choice. By the way, I'm not a 20 something, I'm a grandmother. Also, smoking indoors? Really? And only the mean light up? What century are we in? That is part of the problem with this novel. Most of the time as I read this, I felt like I was reading one that took place 100 years ago, not today. However, the female lead character is a computer programmer. There are secondary characters that are stuck in just to explain the plot but the connections are never made between them and the main characters. And then we have the idea that the main character is a bigot and that's why she didn't marry the guy in the first place. I mean, wasn't she terribly hurt by him and that's why she left? And her father is married to a Native American. On that note, who uses the term Indian any more? I managed to finish this book, but only because I hoped it would improve. It didn't.

745,745,"One of the most amazing things about this book is that it was written in 1914, yet resonates as a modern-feeling, romantic story somewhat along the lines of Sandra Bullock's 2009 comedyThe Proposal.  It doesn't feel dated.  Perhaps you can find the odd, quaint expression here and there or a few old-fashioned limitations on the male-female relationship, but the heroine of this story is a very sassy, smart, independent-minded female.Monica Trant is a well-bred woman now living in reduced circumstances.  She and her brother, who has moved to South Africa, are now the only two members of her family and she is forced to support herself as a working girl in 1900s London, pre-WWI.  Her boss treats all the ""secretaries"" impersonally and dictatorially and seems deficient in personality and human kindness.  As a matter of fact, the girls don't even think of him as a man, but more along the lines of an automaton.So you can imagine Monica's surprise when Mr. Waters asks her to become his ""pretend"" fiancee for one year.  He doesn't give his reasons but the 500 pounds he offers is difficult to refuse, especially when she finds out that her (worthless) brother in South Africa is having financial problems and has asked her to help him out.So she agrees and the story is off and running.  It's mostly written in first person POV and Monica's voice is sassy and funny, her inner dialogue at times a bit snarky but always amusing.  The characters' interactions and dialogue are a hoot and the story moves along entertainingly.  Monica is not fond at all of her boss, Mr. William Waters, at the beginning of the story and Waters is totally disinterested in Monica except as she suits his purposes because of his need for a fake fiancee.Well, you do know what will happen.  It is a romance.  But the getting to the HEA is a lot of fun.  This is worth the read for the romance reader and it's also a little slice of life in 1914 London for some historical interest.  I was charmed by how modern this old romance seemed.  (Berta Ruck, BTW, was born in 1878 and wrote 80 or so novels, mostly romances.

There was NOT ONE OUNCE of story telling or plot development, no new characters introduced to facilitate more books, not even a cliff hanger that would keep you interested and waiting for the next book in the series.  I felt I was reading more of an erotic sex SHORT STORY than a continuation of a series that I came to feel invested in it's characters and plots.  I was sorely disappointed that from the first few pages of the book, there was nothing but very detailed descriptions of sex acts between three people.  Don't get me wrong, that's what a ""Romance Novel"" has in it, but this wasn't even ROMANCE!  I won't even bother to go into the proof reading errors I found, nor the fact that our heroine's mate acts COMPLETELY out of character(what happened to him, PTSD???). I can honestly say, I am seriously thinking about whether or not I want to continue reading the series after feeling so let down by the lack substance, story telling or even imagination.  NOT thrilled...  and again not sure I will continue the series.  This was a serious let down for me.  Regardless of how others review it at ""hot"" and a ""good read"".

Not only is she a vampire, she is a powerful witch, and now the head of the Caelestis vampire family. I really liked this character. She makes mistakes, and learns from them, but it's the relationship between the two men in her life and herself that complicates an already complicated situation!Valentine is also a fantastic character. He is very charismatic and, although he can be a bit intense, he clearly loves Prophecy. He too is now the head of his Aurorea family. Trying to unite the two vampire families against a common foe is harder than he had anticipated. However, Venturi is getting on his last nerve!Venturi is an interesting character. He is quite the charmer, but can be lethal when required. The Tenebrae have a reputation of being fierce warriors, and Venturi is most certainly a formidable one. I liked him very much, even though he has fallen in love with Prophecy too!This story continues on from the end of the second book, and see's the trio trying to track down the rest of the prophecy that foretells what Prophecy's role would be - destroyer or savior - in a war against a formidable foe. This book is a roller coaster ride of action, adventure, danger and romance. I was quickly swept up in the tale and struggled to put the book down! The story is told from three points of view: Prophecy, Valentine and Venturi, which gives the reader the opportunity to see their thoughts and feelings. There are a few twists and turns in this tale that kept me guessing as to what would happen next. However, there is a battle scene that was so well described that I felt like I was actually there - it was EPIC! As I have said in my review of the previous book in the series, I am not fond of love triangles.

That kind of wins her over to his way of thinking. Moving on quickly after a lot of talk and flirting the tattooed man says ""Let me take care of you."" Holy cow! She's not even his type.

If Matt is so kind, loving and crazy about Savannah then why does he let her first sexual experience be so degrading, painful and down right abusive? Really ladies is that the kind of man you would want to spend the rest of your life with? As soon as Savannah walks in to Matts boardroom and he starts to frighten her by ripping her clothes off and getting physical I found myself getting turned off by both characters. At one point Savannah is being abused by two men at once, she is crying so hard that snot is running down her face yet Matt stands there and lets them carry on. Oh yeah he's a keeper. I have to confess to skipping the rest of the book after that and just reading the end and of course it was as predictable as I expected.

775,775,"I enjoyed this story though it does stretch the suspense of disbelief somewhat...and no I don't mean the amazing bondage contraption, the design of which should be patented and test run to be sure..the disbelief is that with someone as attractive, excellent figure & shape, so intelligent and  overtly controlled and controlling could still be a virgin at 35!Had her age been placed at  25 then credibility could have been stretched and possibly accepted. That said it's a lovely fantasy for all bondage and humiliation lovers as to have five hunks for work colleagues who then treat Savannah to such stimulating sexual awakening like that, is the stuff of good imagination and fantasy but in real life is at best non consensual and in law rape. This will be a no-no for many female readers because of this.However, regardless of this, as it's fantasy not real life and many of us may yearn for non consent or rape as a fantasy but wouldn't want these experiences in real life.I like the way Joey Hill leaves the ending, Savannah and her chosen man are left with either a potential HEA ending relationship or possibly still as an opening to further fun and games in the Board Room.  To be sure fantasy is further confirmed as the senior management people of this firm, who would be responsible for ensuring good work practices and no sexual harassment in the workplace; with what unfolds are not exactly the best of exemplars to be in charge of this;-) for sure.I confess this is the first Joey W Hill story I've read and I'm off to purchase the rest of the series and look at her other work.

778,778,"I can see how this novella has polarised other reviewers. It is the story of Savannah who takes over her father's company on his death. It is alluded to that the father/daughter relationship was cold. Savannah is a very uptight, controlling woman, she has issues..... Matt is also in the Corporate world, and he recognises that the way to get through to Savannah and break down the walls she has built to protect herself is through submission.It was pretty far fetched that Matt required the services of his ""Knights of the Boardroom"" to achieve his goal. However this novella was well written, in the author's usual flowing style. The story was compact and the author did manage to compress a lot of detail into what in all probability required a much longer novel.",1,1,0.5472972970000001,0.5472972970000001,CA
779,779,"Well where should I start ..... I finished reading Board Resolution and the wonder that someone could write such a combination of a nebulous teenage wet dream and the fantasies of every inadequate woman hater was overwhelming.The premise that a woman who was as powerful and masterful in a male dominated world of high finance could be reduced to some trembling and sexually desperate slave was such a stretch for my human mind to begin with that I could hardly believe that the author would push me even farther into fantasy land with the thought that a bit of date rape combined with a most creative gang-bang which would be ""just what she needed"" just pushed me over the edge of any possibility to see this as anything more than literary porn written to appeal to men with inadequate equipment and women with severe mental problems.I should pause for a moment to make sure you understand that I am not a fan of erotica (much less BDSM). The reason has nothing to do with the sex but much to do with the fact that almost all of it (with a few notable exceptions) is poorly written, has little if anything resembling a plot outside of writing about sex in various incarnations and generally reduces the characters to little more than what can be done in the erogenous areas between ones legs. The writings of Larissa Ione are more to my speed in this area since she weaves her erotic scenes into an overall plot that while including sex in various forms have an end game that includes more than an orgasm.Back to the story at hand, our dual personality heroine Savannah, who apparently can run a billion dollar corporation but has the need to be date raped and treated like a piece of meat by Matthew Lord Kensington (ya gotta love that name) and brought to the pinnacle of self awareness by a gang-bang of sorts with his buddies. I know what you are thinking, ""What a fantastic love story"" &lt; sarcasm/off> but somewhere along the way anything resembling reality checked out and it might as well have been Star Trek porn (and the actions of this version of ""Scotty the engineer"" are about as impossible as getting that extra bit of warp drive).The HEA of this makes my head spin since I would have tasered his ass on about page 11 and end of story or if I let things play out in this nightmarish scenario, the next step should have been Savannah getting a sexy 40 caliber Glock and polishing these boys off this earth. Apparently, my naivety in the world of BDSM did not realize the proper reaction is to be grateful to the rapists and fall madly in love with one of them. Such is this story and since I don't have a number smaller than the national debt to measure the incredulity of this story all I can say is that it does have a ""train wreck"" appeal but any lasting compulsion to read it again would have me wondering if my secret desire is to become a serial rapist.",1,0,0.545617174,0.0,CA

I'm trying to be polite here and not use the words I really want to use. At first, I thought this must have been written by a man. A woman couldn't have written this but I was wrong and I apologize to the male population.Savannah should have been screaming rape from the get go and the minute she was freed cut off the magic pencils of the oh so generous, considerate, thoughtful, and oh yes well dressed businessmen involved. Who because they gave her SUCH pleasure were only really doing their part because Matt loved her. Let us ignore their physical reactions to the whole incident. Such magnanimous perverts. I actually laughed a few times when I wasn't spitting nails at the philosophical logic behind it all. Honestly, some people will believe anything if someone double talks to them enough.When Savannah asks Matt to please don't hurt her, a little late I thought, but at his reply ""Never, sweet Savannah. I'll destroy anyone who causes you a moment of pain."" I cracked up. I don't think it was the author's intention but it was absurd that he professes his love and devotion after he attacks her and exposes her to the abuse by other men. Savannah is pathetic since once her lovely experience is over she begins to remember Matt's many kindnesses and was impressed that he just 'knew' she is a masochist since he is a sadist.

784,784,"Man, what a load this one is. Let's see, a 35 year old virgin goes to a board meeting and for the most part is either raped by the members of the board or coerced through bondage to have sex (of some kind) with each of them.  So! What's not to like, huh?  My God, is this what women of today aspire to?  Do you actually enjoy reading about a woman trussed up like a cow at a rodeo who is then experimented on by guys with different fetishes? This woman doesn't know she is about to become the center of attention, so to speak, and is certainly not happy with her forced entry into BDSM, yet our wonderful story teller continues with her tale.Matt, the CEO, has rigged up a machine which suspends a woman while fully restraining her at the same time.  With this fantastic device, which just happens to be installed in the board room, he can show our female protagonist just how much he and his fellow board members ""love"" her.I am appalled that the author would have you believe the average woman on the streets would enjoy this type of depravity and would, in fact, state her undying love for her antagonist.  The book has errors and omissions, but the real problem with this type of nonsense is that it gives the impression that if you are a large, dominant, sexually attractive male you can do what you want with a woman and, no matter how weird it is, they will love you for it.  GIVE ME STRENGTH!!!  Look, what you do in the bedroom with your spouse or lover is your business, and if you want to beat each other senseless while having consensual sex, Okay.  Just remember, coerced sex isn't consensual sex; it's rape.  Just because this book is fiction doesn't excuse its implications.  Honey!  Where's my two-by-four???

I mentally raised my hand and screamed `Pick me, pick me....oh please for the love of God, PICK ME.'But I was actually surprised.

It was utterly and completely about her.The only thing that stopped me from giving a full blown 5 heart rating was that my mind couldn't get around the sexual contraption the men used on Savannah. And this wasn't an `author can't describe it properly' issue, it was a `reader has ADD and can't concentrate enough to figure out the configuration of the contraption' issue.The best part???

788,788,"I liked this story a lot!  Right from the beginning, the excitement begins with a glimpse of the ending.  But it is not a spoiler.  Christina is the daughter of Lt Col Patrick Matthews who is a test pilot for Boeing.  He had wanted to be an astronaut, but did not qualify.  Chris loses her mother at 12 yrs of age, and through her next 10 years or so, struggles with the deep loss.  Her father has also become distant to her, thus she became very independent early in life.  She was a tomboy: tough, confident, and one who's motto is, ""Never give in, never give up.""  At a young age she had a solitary goal that she has set for her future.  Finished with high school, Chris and her two very close girl friends form a close bond through the early college years.  Chris decides to take flying lessons and her flight instructor feels she has a natural talent.  The three girls face many challenges, and Chris seems to be the most logical and confident of the girls.  She confronts every conflict they are faced with and becomes a hero.  This story is simply written, easy to read, and may be more suited for older teenagers, but I absolutely loved it.

791,791,"Put the thoughts out of your mind that this is Jane Eyre redux or yet another retread of Beauty and the Beast.  Aside from the fact the hero was burned in a fire, there is nothing similar to Jane Eyre - no gothic terrors, no batty wife in the attic, no creepy castle on the moors, no Rochester or Jane.  Aside from the fact the hero has scars on half of his body, there is no Beauty and the Beast - no gorgeous woman, no beastly man hiding from everyone.The Hero was burned in a fire as he unsuccessfully attempted to rescue his wife.  For three years he has removed himself from Society, first and foremost to heal from his wounds (not hiding in a drafty mansion like an ogre!).  He had to relearn to move his arms and legs, to walk, to live again.  He also stayed away due to the stares, the whispers, and the innuendo surrounding the fire, but it was not a retreat into a self-imposed exile where he lost all sense of how to interact with other people.  He was not ""beastly,"" just injured and weary from the stares.The heroine is considered plain, spinsterish, and a bluestocking - not Belle/Beauty for sure, nor a cowed orphan victimized by family and Society as the governess Jane, either.  She has firm opinions and expresses them when she feels she must.  She is a scientist, working with plants and soil and experiments.  She wears spectacles and is raven-haired and dark-eyed, perhaps the biggest drawbacks in a time where fair skin and hair were the standard of beauty.I think this is a story of what it means to love - how you are afraid of putting yourself out there to be rejected, how you wonder what the other person truly thinks when they look at you, how you worry about saying the right or wrong thing all the time.  It's a story of learning to trust another person with your whole self, to take the leap of faith and try to read the signs that your interest in returned, your companionship is welcomed, that you are interesting to someone else.  Both the H and h are walking wounded, for different reasons, and believe that they have too many negatives to interest another.  He hates his scars and the looks and talk they generate.  He was betrayed by his first wife and his trust was destroyed.  She has been the looked-over girl her entire life, only appreciated by her family.  She has never dared to dream of a future of a husband and children; she thinks her intellect and her plainness too much to overcome.  Together, slowly, the H and h learn to get back what they have lost and begin what they had yet to have.  I loved their love story, their friendship, their respect of each other.  I especially loved how the h became more beautiful, to the H and to others, as her true nature was allowed to blossom.  It is a truth that beauty does come from within, and even the plainest of creatures will shine and sparkle when they are appreciated, acknowledged, loved.  The author illustrates this fact beautifully in both the H and h.There are secondary characters that do exactly what they should - serve as foils for the main characters, the H and h, and set their storyline up.  They move in the background and lend interest in their interaction.  We learn more about the H/h from their friends and families.  There is also a subplot that throws in a little danger and again, this only adds to the relationship budding between the H and h.  They grow closer and learn more about each other as they face this threat.  I guessed who the threat was from the outset, but that in no way detracted from my wanting to see how the plot resolved.  There are some typos and typesetting errors scattered throughout the book, and frankly I cannot understand why independents or traditionally published authors can't get these cleaned up when they are pointed out, but errors like this do not keep me from reading nor recommending a book wholeheartedly.One warning: there is explicit sex in this book.  It is written of in a loving and tender way, but it is sensual and explicit.",1,1,0.541147132,1.0,WI

On their way to solving the problem between them, they put up with unwelcome visitors, a match-making mama, Magnus' best friend, a surprise for Agatha from America, and last but not least, a murderer.  Even though I pretty much pinned the murderer almost from the very beginning, and the basic reason, it was fun traveling through the process with the two main characters.  Magnus, a loner and product of an unhappy childhood and a difficult first marriage and Agatha, a loner and a female scientist who is not popular at all and while not happy, not terribly unhappy, piece together what begins as a sort of Marriage of Convenience and work it into a real marriage of trust and finally, love.  There were a few surprises along the way with both these two insecure people finding security in each other.

The plot of this book is somewhat unique, in that the h and H choose to marry each other purely because they desire to do so......the heroine is not pressured into marrying the hero, neither does she need to marry him, or he her.  What made this story very poignant is the major inferiority complex suffered by both characters.Agatha is super smart and intelligent, but a bit on the plain side, while the hero, Magnus, was horribly scarred in a fire.  Magnus and Agatha literally run into each other at a ball.  Their encounter, although brief, is significant and changes the course of their lives forever.  Magnus cannot stop thinking about Agatha, so much so that he ends up making her an offer of marriage, which she accepts.  At the conclusion of the marriage ceremony, Agatha becomes nervous because she knows that Magnus is about to kiss her.  It's her first kiss and she is afraid she will embarrass herself and Magnus.Unfortunately, Magnus misinterprets her trembling as fear, and so instead of giving Agatha a ""proper"" kiss, he merely kisses her on the forehead.  This results in Agatha believing that Magnus does not find her physically attractive.  This misunderstanding between the two sets the tone for the beginning of their marriage.  Matters are not helped by the fact that Magnus refuses to consummate the marriage because he is too ashamed of the severe scars on his body (although Agatha does not know that that is his reason for refusing to do so).The story that unfolds is a beautiful one about two people who learn to overcome their insecurities, risk their hearts, and discover a love that is beautiful and timeless.There is also a bit of intrigue as someone is trying to kill Agatha.  Humor is added to the plot in the guise of Lord Crittenden, Magnus' best friend, whose mother is so desperate to marry him off that she literally follows him around with a host of potential brides.  LOL  The story held my interest from the very beginning, and stirred true emotion within me, laughter, sorrow, and anger.

Agatha is a wonderful heroine, smart, intelligent, determined, and brave.  And Magnus is absolutely wonderful!  The poor man suffered so much about his appearance that it broke my heart.  He thought himself a monster.  Although a bit gruff and aloof, he was always so terribly sweet with Agatha.  The reader gets to see these two wonderful people fall in love.

But, different people respond to a work in different ways.I thought it had an interesting premise and am drawn to Marian themes, Catholicism and mysticism in general but this was just a ridiculous plot.I've downloaded a few other of his novels that seemed interesting and will try those to see if his work has improved any.Update:  Although I didn't think much of this novel, another reviewer mentioned how good the 'Repairman Jack' series was - and it really is.  I've read three of them now and am on my fourth, and they are as good, and probably better, than any crime/suspense series out there.  What a nice surprise.  Really excellent and highly recommended.

It's one of those shorts where you are thrown into a situation and get to live through this one particular night with the characters. Sometimes in a short, it feels too short, that you are missing something. Here I didn't get that feeling. Sure, there is backstory and who knows what happens next, but in this very important moment in the character's lives, it's a complete tale.This was previously published in Weird Tales.

I acknowledge that it does mirror Pride and Prejudice in its plot rather closely; nevertheless, it was original enough to hold me.I was fooled by the epilogue into thinking that there were actual historical figures in the book; it was cleverly done!

812,812,"This book was quite a surprise for me. I have not delved into science fiction much, to be quite honest I have only read Ann Aguirre's Jax series so far. I never thought that it would be a genre I would enjoy much and Captured proved me wrong.It's a strong story with a lot of world building and very easy to get lost into. Mari has been taken from her home on Earth and awakens in a spaceship where she is a prisoner. She meets Ekkatt, a humanoid alien that works for an organization in his planet that takes human women and sells them in the meat-market.Yep, you read that right. I do not even mean they became sexual slaves, which would have been horrible enough. Apparently human meat is a delicacy to a lot of interplanetary species and what is worse, they don't even acknowledge that humans are sentient creatures and regard us all as unthinking animals.Mari waking up during that trip changes everything. No prisoner has ever woken up before and by being rational and opinionated she shows Ekkatt that things are not what he has been led to believe.I loved the growth both characters go through and how much they teach each other and come to rely in one another. It's a beautiful love story and both Ekkatt and Mari are great leading characters and sooooo hot together hehe.Their journey for survival and right to exist and just be together is great to follow and the only fault I have found in this book was that it was too short. I wanted more and more and Julia had a such a rich world and story that there is much more to be told in that world.If you are up to an awesome sci-fi romance, this is the book for you!Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}",1,1,0.537091988,0.583382789,WI
813,813,"This is a wonderful novella.  It's a complete story, and well told.  The characters are fully fleshed and I cared about them.  The love story is beautiful.  A previous reviewer thought that the writing was awful.  I'd have to disagree.  The author wrote sparely, but nothing was left out, or compromised, and the editing was great.  I wish it had been longer, because I really like the characters, and I wanted to know what happened to them, ultimately.  There could very well be a sequel.  But, it didn't end on a cliffhanger.This is a pretty classic story of love and deep ties between different races, or, in this case, different species who happen to share enough DNA to be sexually compatible.  The foundational story is complex, and told sketchily.  We are told just enough to understand the action.  It's enough.  Another reviewer thought that the book was more like an outline than a complete book.  I disagree with that evaluation, as well.  The book is complete.There is, for such a short novel, an amazing amount of personal growth in the main characters, particularly in Ekkatt, the male lead, who has to surmount a lifetime of being told humans are nothing more than insensate beasts.  He finds himself in the unusual circumstance of interacting with a conscious human, who proceeds to destroy all of his established beliefs.  This is the story of Ekkatt and Mari, one of the human women he and his crew have &#34;harvested&#34; from Earth to bring back to the meat markets on his own planet.  He is immediately confronted with the evidence that everything he has been told is a lie, but, of course, resists that knowledge at first.Mari and Ekkatt's story is very romantic.  The love scenes are intensely erotic, but far more sublime than you will see in most romance novels.  There is a sense of wonder within all these scenes (and there are plenty) that is truly exalted.Is it the best book I've read this year?  No, but it's a very lovely story.

Fortunately Bruce hears her cursing and rescues her from her predicament. He's staying at a nearby bondage ranch and when he brings her there at first she's appalled by what she sees. With Bruce's gentle coaxing, she eventually submits to her own desires and to him and when the weekend ends, she knows she can't return to ""vanilla"". As for Bruce, he sees in her a woman he could truly make his own...if he could only fully leave his past behind.Many BDSM stories focus on the more physically intense aspects of play with the Dominants being more intense and dark. In contrast, Bruce is what could probably be termed as a sensual Dominant, preferring the mental path of domination. He's wonderfully gentle to the new-to-BDSM, albeit enthusiastic Laera and one gets the idea that this is more his style than an affected behavior simply for her. Preferring intricate roping to edgier play, he is nonetheless quietly confident in his own skin. It was, however, intriguing reading about some of Bruce's hang-ups regarding the term ""Master"", as many seem to prefer the term.The secondary characters in this story are equally interesting, especially Mistress Sue. Not one to be particularly attracted to women Dominants, she warmed my heart and made me think she'd definitely be a woman I'd want on my side.

This couple communicates!  So different from so much M/M, where failure to communicate manufactures some bogus drama/conflict, when just one person speaking up as if he was a mature adult would have avoided the trouble.  And there are additional scenes of warmth and love as a few secondary characters go through some of their own trials.  When our leads have the sex, get out your fan and stay near the fainting couch.  Gotta say one noticeable flaw.  It is a big deal in the real world when a boss initiates sex, or worse, a relationship, with an employee.  No matter how consensual.

Penny novels, etc. They had to have something to get readers excited.  And an orangutan was exotic, unfamiliar to readers of the time, so capable of pretty much any darn thing. Made the story fun, I thought.I actually got rather fond of the crabby, misshapen, brainy but lonely hero in the long run, as did his sidekick.  Only thing is, I kept envisioning one of our latter day ""aliens""  or even Pinky's ""Brain"" with all the talk about his big skull.

She does, he doesn't. What was probably supposed to be drama, when repeated over and over and over is not. The inability of the main characters to believe anything but the worst of each other leads the reader to conclude they are morons rather than successful adults.- Phrases joined together all over the place with commas and conjunctions when they should have been separate sentences.It's pretty basic: you can have the best story idea in the world, and you may even be able to write it, but if you don't get an EDITOR to tighten it up and correct the errors you can't or don't see, it ends up reading like a teenager of average intelligence wrote it for an English class.This review sounds snarkier than I intended, but I'm getting really tired of reading uneditted books (I think most of you have figured that out by now).",1,0,0.546218487,0.0,WI

He treated the heroine like crap. All he wanted was to have sex with her, even when he believed she was his brother's girlfriend. And then he did. What kind of brother does that? A big no no for me is also when the hero sleeps with other women,(implied) even if he and the heroine were on a break. Granted, they were on a break for 6 months but if he cared anything about the girl he wouldn't be jumping into someone else's bed.What irritated me about the heroine is she hates him one minute, and sleeps with him the next. She's wishy washy and her character is weak. You didn't get the feel that there was any real warmth, even real lust developing between them.

I enjoy the way he writes and he seems to have great insight into many pertinent topics. In this book he argues that prayer doesn't change God's mind but rather it changes things that happen. At first this doesn't make sense and sounds a bit confusing. But I'm willing to trust that it is true.What I liked best about this book is the explanations about the Lord's Prayer. Through example we can learn to pray much more effectively. R. C. Sproul encourages the reader to indulge in ""fervent adoration of God."" He also talks a lot about repentance and has some strong things to say about sin hindering our prayers.To me, the writing style of the author is at times majestic and I felt I could fully respect the author as he seems to be quite the expert on the topic of prayer. His conclusions were all very logical and he really goes into detail therefore making the book very practical and helpful.I am impressed with the clarity of R. C. Sproul's thoughts and can highly recommend yet another book in this series.I really didn't need to read a book on prayer to believe God listens. For he truly does and I have examples in my life to prove it. All I can say is never to ask God lightly for patience.

I love the how the relationship developed between Arslan and Ryland. I particularly liked Arslan, the leader of the pride and the master of Ryland's heart.Ryland is a college kid down on his luck and out of scholarship funding to complete his degree. So he has two choices.  He can take a loan from a less then honorable student or he can sell himself to the lions for a night, to be the plaything of their choosing. While blind folded and naked in the room full of lions, he never expected to meet the man of his dreams, one who would also become the master of his heart.Professor Arslan is the leader of his pride and must do whatever it takes to protect them from themselves and their mates. So he never accepts the feeling of protectiveness or the thoughts to claim his pet as his and his alone. But in order for a pet to be part of the pride, he must come to the pride of his own free will and without any benefit to himself. So begins the problem of the two sometimes ill-fated lovers, because the benefits part throws a curve into the mix.I've always liked shifter stories and I was intrigued with the concept of lions.

908,908,"Aptly titled, ""Second Chance Romance"" follows high school and college sweethearts Kip Turner and Mandy Green, who after 11 years still carry a torch for each other. With both of them now 30 years old, with Kip a successful professional hockey player who plays for the NHL while Mandy is a school teacher and single mom, they reconnect through Facebook and find themselves searching for their happily-ever-after.Great premise for a beautiful love story. Unfortunately, the telling was flat and the characters remained two-dimensional until the end. And though this book is classified erotica, and I would rate this M for mature audience only because of sex and language use, classifying this erotica is using the term loosely.Erotica as a genre already has a lot of detractors. And of course, those who read erotica already knows that it can go either way, one extreme is that it is outright porn, while the other end of the spectrum is that erotica is a beautiful story wherein sex scenes are part of the telling and it will not be complete without it. Case in point, ""In the Realm of the Senses"", a 1976 Franco-Japanese romantic drama film directed by Nagisa Oshima, is perhaps one of the best examples of the erotica genre.""Second Chance Romance"" has all the elements of the latter side of the spectrum of the genre. An exciting hero who is not just good looking but very athletic; a painfully shy heroine who blossomed as she gained more confidence as the love story proceeds. Unfortunately, the book fell short on everything about storytelling.And that is the reason why I am really disappointed that the story and the characters remained flat. There really was no climax to speak of; the struggles were minimal and though we know that Kip and Mandy deserve their HEA, the telling of how they got there left a lot to be desired.So, why the two star rating instead of one? Just like the lesson of the book, everyone deserves a second chance.

Reviewed by JAMESWell if you've read the first book then you will what to read more and if you haven't read it then go read it. Well Nizhoni is dead as is Simon and Red Two and I bet you all that have read the first book hate the Hunters. Now on to the second book.  Zack is now the leader of Red Squadron and Fintan is really sad that Nizhoni is dead and her last words were"" They Cannot hurt one that has dreamed a dream like me."". DANG YOU HUNTERS!!!!!! Now that Zack is the leader Red squadron is so much different than it was. Red squadron got new members and one of them was named Rachel. I think Fintan has a crush on Rachel after a little bit. When Red squadron won the Starball match they got a trip to Saturn. On Saturn they got to watch and help gather metallic hydrogen from Saturn. On the way back to the moon base when they opened the worm hole something went wrong and the ship called the Destiny crashed on a thought to be a different planet but went forward in time to Earth. It was void of all live except for some animals. Future Ayako left a message for Fintan saying that the Hunters attacked the Earth and destroyed all life on Earth.

911,911,"In paranormal I need to be able to view the hero as somewhat human.  I had a hard time managing that with this story.  In the beginning a Zorn Warrior,  Argernon, saves Casey from men who are chasing her.  Argernon & Casey can't communicate so he just throws her over his shoulder & carries her to a cave he's been using while scouting out her planet.  She thinks he's a bigfoot and wants to take him home and keep him because he's ""hot"".  Apparently, he thinks she's hot too, because he grunts/growls at her while gesturing for her to take off her clothes while he strips & continuously points between her & his bed.  Of course, she doesn't usually do this type of thing, but he's hot so even though they've just met, all reservations are set aside.  She strips and gets in bed, still thinking he's a bigfoot.  In the midst of deciding to have sex with him, she even decides she doesn't need to worry about getting pregnant because different species, like cats & dogs, can't procreate.  Just Ewww!When Casey finds herself on Argernon's ship, communication occurs, & she finds out he isn't a bigfoot but an alien and plans to take her to his planet.  She becomes uncooperative.  In several scenes he ties her up and forces himself inside her (while she's pleading with him to leave her alone) because he can smell her excitement.  He even smilingly asks, in his all-knowing male way, if men on her planet are so weak that they listen when women say no.  ?!?!On top of all this, I thought Casey acted completely immature, getting mad at Argernon and throwing fits for stuff that was completely out of his control (but forgiving him for rape), the story was dumb, and the writing was juvenile.  And I liked the first book enough to pay for this second in the series!  I won't be reading this author again.And this is so petty, I hate to mention it, but did anyone else think the cover was unappealing?  He seemed to have a shrunken head compared to the rest of his body, which just emphasized the whole alien thing.

912,912,"~ 1.5 Kidnaping Stars ~Kidnapping Casey is book two in the Zorn Warriors series by Laurann Dohner. If your a fan of forced seduction then this book will work for you. I did not enjoy it. To close to rape for my liking.Unlike the first book Ral&#8217;s Woman where Ral shows a genuine affection and protective concern for his human, Argernon dose not show these qualities for Casey until much much later in the book. Argernon is entirely shellfish and demands that Casey stay; because he can&#8217;t live without her. He gives her no choice. The same seduction techniques that Argernon uses are just like her ex who was trying to forcer her, and she should have told Argernon and he should have backed off and gotten to know her without the bondage. It felt like a broken record with the seduction your body wants me ergo your heart does too. Around 30% into the book we get some action outside the bedroom which was a change, but other then that it&#8217;s all about Argernon not letting Casey go.If you like to read a series in order then I recommend this book, but in general if your into overbearing alien men who don&#8217;t have a clue about women&#8217;s rights and like to use sex as a weapon to get what they want then you&#8217;ll like this, otherwise I would not recommend this one.",1,0,0.573476703,0.022448595,CO

915,915,"I was frustrated with this book. I really love Dohner's New Species series, but I'll have to say that I'm not going to be reading anymore about Zorn Warriors.I can respect Dohner's ability to create dynamic cultures in her books. I read Ral's Woman and decided to give Kidnapping Casey a try, but I honestly wish I didn't. I don't like the culture of Zorn (I can respect Dohner's ability to create it, but it doesn't mean that I necessarily like it). I get that its an Alpha Male borderline D/s world, but the way that Argernon and Casey's relationship played out just wasn't cool for me.I'll have to agree with other reviewers here that rape = rape, yes, even if your rapist brings you to orgasm. I thought it was sweet that Argernon cared about Casey so much. I get that she's a gamechanger for him. I don't like that he tied her up (twice) and after she repeatedly says no (twice), they still end up doing the deed and Casey's all right with it. Oh, and he ties her up afterwards, because he doesn't trust her. And keeps her tied up for days, even making her wear a chastity belt so she can't please herself, and parades around in front of her trying to make her want him. Seems like the Zorn guys are no better than their pointy-eared counterparts, the Collis. I did not like Argernon, because he never learns that it is not ok to kidnap and rape someone. Its not ok to replace 3 girls last minute and expect your new girl to accept you. And Casey just seemed like a silent victim. I felt sorry for her. Somebody said that she was strong and could hold her own... silent strength and holding on to her pain? Yea.I felt like maybe I would've liked this book better if it was drawn out a bit more. Like, I would've liked to see Casey go to Berrr and get unbounded. Then she could've dated and get Argernon to win her love. But whatever. This book is what it is. This is the end of the Zorn for me.

918,918,"The Riddler's Gift by Greg Hamerton is one of the best novels I have read in a while. The length is intimidating at first, over 1000 pages, but don't let that deter you, each page begs you to go one more, oftentimes teasing you into putting off sleep for one more chapter. The characters are well thought out and formed, each feeling like a living breathing person. The world is formed around you, not made for you, and as you continue you learn more about your surroundings, finding out who lives where, and trying to find a place to sit down, so you can take a rest from the fast pace of the first half of the novel. You begin by learning the history of Eyri, and are then thrown into the conflict headfirst, not given a second to bring your head up for water, but instead hold your breath as the character finds her foot being put onto her journey for her.Tabitha Serannon is a young girl who seems to be foolish, and easily turned around. Don't let this fool you, throughout the novel her strength increases until the final climax. She is often accompanied by a man entitled The Riddler, and through this companion, we find not only the mystery of the novel, but the humor as well. As the story progresses into a dark mist that keeps your mind probing in different direction, hoping to find a light, The Riddler guides you through his twisted speech, and his manner of avoiding the truth, while never telling a lie. I found myself looking for pieces that included him, just to see what he would say next. Most chapters begin with a quote by The Riddler, and give you something to think about before plunging into the next piece of your journey. Around halfway there's a period of relaxation for the reader, where the pace slows down, before the long uphill journey begins again. If you thought the beginning was a ride, wait till you read the rest. I found myself most enthralled by the final half, as more rules to this world are introduced, accompanied by greater risks, larger rewards, and the final climax that you will hold your breath for. I was absolutely dismayed as I turned the pages furiously at the end, wanting to know what would happen next, and then the battery for my kindle gave its last breath as the screen went blank, right before I had to go to bed. When I finally managed to get to them, I waited on every word, hoping to know the fate of our young Serannon and ...... well I can't tell you the second part, I guess you will have to read to find out.For the price of the novel, you can't find a better deal, it is five times the size of many novels out on the market, and even has the benefit of being part of a series, currently having a sequel. With more journeys to be had, greater risks to be taken, and rules to be searched out, the second book promises to be a ride as well. If you have the money, I highly recommend this book, and would encourage anyone to take their journey into the wonderful world of Eyri.Note: A Free Review copy was provided by the author.",1,1,0.581210191,0.528861465,CO

924,924,"I went into Devil's Lair with a lot of excitement, eager for a read on one of my favorite historical eras. That it promised to include generous helpings of Dante's Inferno made me even more eager.I have to say that I was not disappointed. Wisehart does a magnificent job with character development, painting a vivid portrait of deep characterization on very different people--the wounded knight, the fallen priest, Giovanni the poet, and the epileptic woman with visions.I felt the development of the characters was exceptionally well done in the first half of the book, while action and a faster pace dominated the second half. I have read Dante's Inferno a few times, and I enjoyed it, but I wonder if someone not familiar with Dante would find as much pleasure in Devil's Lair.The only complaint I have is Wisehart's use of his obviously extensive vocabulary. I love being sent to the dictionary now and then to learn a new word, or to get clarification on what I thought was the proper definition of a word, but I found myself going a little too often in Devil's Lair. Ordinarily I wouldn't mind so much, with electronic reading and the dictionary literally at your fingertips, but--and this might be an annoyance for some--many of the words weren't even listed in the Kindle dictionary, so I was forced to look them up on Google. While this was enlightening in one sense, it was frustrating in another. I felt that 90% of the time the author could have made his point just as well with a simpler word.Devil's Lair is not a typical page-turner in the sense of action, or mystery; it is more a book that must be devoured one delicious page at a time, and I did just that. It took me longer to read than most books, but then again, this one made me stop and think--something I relish, as I don't do enough of it. The descriptions in Wisehart's book are detailed, the story is true to the era and the masterpiece it draws so well from, and the dialogue can be thought provoking and enlightening.If you are a fan of Dante's Inferno, or enjoy that era of Italian history, by all means I would recommend you pick up Devil's Lair.

And it's set in a world after the apocalypse of massive hurricanes caused by global warming, with much of coastal Florida and California washed away.  But when you're laughing out loud on almost every other page, it's hard to wring your hands at your and the planet's impending doom.  This is a very well written book and a huge bargain at the price.  Not error-free but with fewer than the amount of typos you'd expect from a budget book.  I give it four stars for being a lot of fun and for being more than a step above a self-published work.However, where's the plot?  New Coastal Times is simply a narrative of a trip from coastal Florida to upstate New York.  Plenty of trenchant observations and wise-cracking about the human condition as the locales change.  But there was never any plot development.  I thought Donna Callea was going there with the events surrounding New Utopia 376, but that thread was just left there for the next leg of the journey.  There was a possibility for something really sinister but the road trip had to continue.  And there was no denouement at the end, let alone a climax.So, what's the recommendation?  This book is an excellent read at a very good price.  Amazon estimates it at approximately 192 pages and at $2.99 that's great value for money for writing of this quality.  I really hope Donna Callea keeps writing, with an eye to more plot development and ambiguity.  Those of you who are looking for something dark will probably be disappointed.

And although the situations they find themselves in could actually be incredibly dangerous, their outlook and friendships make it seem much more like a road trip.Engaging, sarcastic and unique, I really enjoyed all of New Coastal Times, but most especially the characters.

When its determined that she cant breed with the race they use her as the prize in a fight between other races of slaves. Ral, a Zorn, wins her. So what does the hero do???? He takes her straight to his room and forces her to have sex with him. REAL ROMANTIC. Within a few days Ral and a couple of other Zorn conveniently highjack a ship and escape. By this point Ariel is in love with Ral. But when they get back to his planet everyone hates her and is against her. And again she is a wall flower and does whatever he says. Oh but lets not forget that they can no longer communicate with one another because the devices the other alien race put on them that allowed them to understand one another have been removed. The topping on the crap cake is when Ariel is almost raped by three Zorn men. The reason behind this is just awesome...... Ariel and Ral were recorded getting it on at the medical center... it was recorded and put on their form of internet. The Zorn men saw how hot it was and decided they wanted it too.Im sure the author was aiming at erotica but it fell short... really short. There is no character development. The author tried to put WAY to many things into a story of this length.  The ""love"" Ariel feels for Ral is more like Stockholm syndrome.* I do not base my review on price.

But the ""alien"" men ended up sounding JUST LIKE the New Species men, down to the long hair and slightly wider nose and sharp teeth.  They are also kind of clueless in how human woman are.  The only reason I'm not giving this book 5 stars is because there is absolutely no build-up to the first sex scene, which happens in the very beginning of the book.

I am suppose to be doing a review not drooling.So moving on.In Ral's Woman we first start off with Ariel being trapped in a cave. She has been kidnapped from Earth by the alien race Anzon  for the sole purpose of breeding with the alien race. Apparently when it comes to Anzon's their are more men than women and they need to breed with outsiders otherwise their race will die out. Turns out humans are not compatible. Yay us. Bad thing is her captor still wants to have sex with her and is he does Ariel will die. Lucky the female captor intervenes and Ariel is spared that torture. So now she is given as a prize to which ever slave can win the battle. In steps Ral, the leader of the slaves. He single handedly takes on all the other slaves and wins Ariel. Instead of giving her up to one of the other slaves like he has done in the past, he keeps her for himself. Ariel doesn't know what to think. She believes that Ral wants to harm her like the Anzon's wanted too. Ral has another plan. He wants to make her his mate for life.  He takes her with him when he and some other slaves escape and go back to Zorn. Life on Zorn is not great for Ariel. The only person that likes her is Ral. Ariel sticks it out and proves to everyone that she loves Ral.I enjoyed this story because it felt that even though it was short, it wasn't just a book about sex it had a pretty good storyline. I liked the author's writing and the fact that she did not use a complicated language that is typically associated with sci-fi. The author's writing flowed very well and she packed in quite a bit of info for a short book.Ral is my favorite character. He is very dominate and possessive over Ariel but still loving and caring. He is sexy as hell and a stealth fighter. He takes one a lot of people for Ariel's honor.Hyvin Berrr, Ral's father, he is a jerk but his reaction to Ariel is expected. His son was kidnapped and now he brings back a woman from another planet. He is not sure what to make of it. He did make a huge mistake of making a sex tape of Ral and Ariel and having everyone see it without his knowledge. At the end he does make things up to his son.Overall I liked this story. It was a great set up to the series. I plan on adding the rest of the books to my already packed kindle. I admit there where moments were the story was a little lack luster but overall it was great.

It was only after finishing that I started to think about the view of Earth relationships that Ariel forced on  the Zorn.

944,944,"The first book in the Zorn Warriors series is off to an interesting start. I agree, Ral does seem a bit Conan the Barbarian or maybe George of the Jungle like...but I get the point that he and Ariel don't understand each other but found a way to get along and communicate in other ways. The biology of the characters was interesting and descriptive. I usually don't read sci-fi, let alone sci-fi-romance but this one worked for me.Ariel offered directions to the United States so we can only see what happens next.I hope this series has women from all different ethnic backgrounds in the next few books. I respect authors more when they diversify.Anyhow, back to the point of this review. I enjoyed the book and the fact that Ariel found a way to make do with her situation. There is a part 3/4 of the way through where the editing is HORRIBLE and that bugged me a great deal but it only looked like one paragraph exploded. She doesn't piss, moan, or complain about the fact that she's removed from Earth or her family or her job or anything like that. This is a heroine who takes things as they come and doesn't whine about it! Finally!!!! I can respect that in anyone, but especially in a case where she's been removed from everything. Ral considers moving to Earth, though I don't think that would have ever worked. But then again, I'm not in charge of this universe. If you're into sci-fi this book has a bit more romance in it. If you're looking for alien trysts there are a few in this book and it gets fairly descriptive. I definitely enjoyed it and like 365andme said, he's got a basic vocabulary but it adds to his charm later.I can't wait to read the next one!",0,1,0.5730659029999999,0.43075453700000005,KY

With that being said here's what I can tell you about what I have read--there's no character development, Ral all but rapes Ariel in the first chapter, he's not really a sexy leading man with his razor sharp teeth which kinda makes the ""love"" scene a little scary, he talks like a caveman but is some super strong intelligent alien race. Ariel, while I could see would be some frightened girl is pretty much a shell she has no personality and falls in love with this Alien who rapes her and finds she just loves having sex with him, here I can only say . . . wait . . . what? There's too many poorly written sex scene don't get me wrong I love a good romance and I appreciate well written love scenes but these were lack luster and seemed to come on every other page. Also once they make it to his home planet the author was not very creative, the world consist of three colors, I love red, purple and black but the whole planet in this three color palette is boring. She also seems to like the words snarl and growl they were used far too often, using the same words over and over again makes reading this book tedious.

If it's a pet peeve, you might not be able to get beyond the first chapter.Femilla, the goddess of Womankind, has a duty to right grievious wrongs committed against women. As such, there are men in her keeping who are punished in the afterlife by the demon Demeana because they brutalized women when alive. Not all are beyond redemption, but must prove their rehabilitation. Andrew Regent is one of these men. After his death in 1509, he was tortured in the afterlife. But every one hundred years he has a chance. He returns to mortal life for a month. If he can find a woman to love who loves him in return, he will be saved. If he doesn't, he must withstand another hundred years of torture before he can try again. Many do not make it, give up and are consumed by the demon. It is now 2009 and Caitlin is his chance at salvation. As they get to know one another, Caitlin starts dreaming of the life of another woman, Catherine, the woman whose death caused Andrew to be condemned in the afterlife.This is a typical time travel/time slip romance which is fairly predictable. The characterization is excellent. The story, while a bit trite at times, is well constructed and dialogue is good. It is well plotted and consistent. But the formatting errors are crazy-making, so much so that I almost didn't finish the book. There are some grammar errors which also really distract, such as the Hero having ""chaffed"" ankles, and the Heroine feeling better after her morning ""adulations"". Oh, and Andrew is a ""genus"" with old weapons. I wonder what his species is?And this may seem minor, but glaring errors in covers really bug me. For instance, in the story Andrew is supposed to be blonde and the cover model obviously isn't. Yes, he's yummy, but it just doesn't fit. Additionally, you never put on bracers before putting on your shirt, unless you plan on fighting without one which frankly only happens in Conan movies and Frank Frazetta artwork.Before writing this, I checked the current publication date to see if maybe I just had an out of date download. But apparently that isn't the case and shows a lack of care and/or professionalism as several other reviewers have mentioned the grammar and formatting issues in the past. It's quite a shame, because this book could be a 3.5 or even 4 star work with just a bit more effort.",1,0,0.611001965,0.0,KY

Even though it was short I found myself smiling and even laughing a few times at some of the character and his daughters' antics.  I think I mainly enjoyed it so much simply because it was just real.  I found myself nodding my head at some of the things the girls would do because my own daughters would do the same things.

Then the author must have fallen down the rabbit hole and started writing just like every other romance author because this book was terrible. First of all, it wasn't a romance. It was a mixture of never ending plot twists that weren't cohesive at all thrown together with a sex scene which was totally out of place. How many misunderstandings can one couple encounter? This author would have you believe weeks could go by where the two main characters couldn't have a two second conversation which would have solved everything. Usually this kind of thing doesn't bother me but this book DRAGGED. Very boring, very poorly written characters and a HUGE disappointment when the last book was so good.

979,979,"This book charts the romance of two secondary characters from a previous novel The Marriage List. It is a fabulous book. Despite the ""sexy"" moniker, this book is actually not smutty at all. There is 1 sex scene that was absolutely delicious and 1 other scene which did not involve sex but pretty much everything else. The erotic blended with the romance in a completely believable way. It was very well-written. The characters are excellent as well. I am intrigued by Lillian and would like to read her story. Lady Iona is an untouchable paragon, or so she seems. In reality her cold, perfect exterior hides a passionate inner self that longs to break free. After helping her friend in romance and meeting Lord Wynters, Iona's staid existence is no longer enough. A chance meeting in Bath with Lord Wynters gives Iona the perfect ploy to break out of her overly obedient and dutiful life: she will ask Lord Wynters to give her lessons on living the life of a rogue, taking her pleasures when and where she wants them and in the process she will learn how to emerge from her shell and take over control of her own life. Nathan, Lord Wynters, wants to put some polish on his blackened reputation in an effort to seal the life-long breach between him and the rest of his family. A respectable marriage should do the trick and who should he find staying in Bath, the lovely Lady Iona, a woman he had fallen in love with once and foolishly chased across the country only to be disappointed. Her reputation is more sterling than silver, she is gorgeous, and they were friends once; she's perfect. This story is more tragic than comic but it has its moments of levity. I greatly admire Iona's strength of character in the face of losing everything she held dear and of course, Nathan's unrequited love and passion and refusal to admit defeat - refreshing for a hero.

I squirmed when the main characters held the truth from each other but that made the book unable to be put down till finished.

984,984,"**warning*** this review has some spoilersIt's not just the characters who are frustrated throughout the book, it was myself as well.I had high hopes for the story line, it was a novel approach and I enjoyed reading a romance from this time period set in Bath rather than in London. The main characters are engaging and the writing style is well done. But then the frustrations start.First of all,  Lady Iona is downright awful at anything approaching communication. She lets her family shut her up all the time, even when her very happiness depends on it. And then she constantly thinks about telling Nathan the truth about her father's plan to engage her to her cousin, but she never actually brings it up. It takes her forever to explain to him why she won't marry him. And then once he insists on the marriage, even after he's told her how impressed he is with her artwork and how he'll support her in the endeavor, she immediately starts assuming that he'll crush the happiness out of her and not let her do the things she wants to do. I have NO idea where she got that idea, and she never even asks him about it! I'm not really sure who she was rebelling against... it mostly seemed to be like she was rebelling against her assumptions rather than what people actually wanted/expected from her.Not that Nathan's much better at communication, but at least he tries to talk to HER even if he doesn't clear up things with his family - not that they're listening to him anyway.She's also more than a little bit selfish, but even once she realizes that she's behaving selfishly, she doesn't stop! And she behaves more than a little recklessly, putting herself in danger in ways that IF she truly had spent time helping women of the lower classes like she says she does, then she would know better. I understand wanting to make her seem innocent and naive, but in a lot of the situations she goes way too far and it just becomes ludicrous.And then we have the ridiculous about turn of her family.  Not only did her mother warn off Nathan from her - long before he had truly become a rake, and we never get a real explanation for that... unless the rumor about him ruining another girl was out beforehand? but even then, why would the DUCHESS be the one visiting and telling him that, shouldn't it be up to Iona's father? - but her father goes from punching Nathan in the face one night and insisting that she must marry her cousin as he's planned, to the next morning hearing Nathan out and then declaring that Iona must marry Nathan to save HIS reputation? Why on earth does her father suddenly believe Nathan's accounting of events? Out of freaking NOWHERE?!There is a good story within this book, unfortunately it's hampered by way too many obstacles which bog down the plot line, an overabundance of bad communication between characters (to the point where I almost put the book down because they were annoying me so much with their ridiculousness), and ludicrous turn-arounds from several of the side characters who suddenly start behaving supportive without any explained motivation. That being said; I did adore Lord Nathan and the end of his story was immensely satisfying. I just wish that Lady Iona and her family hadn't been so ridiculously eye-roll worthy.",1,0,0.550925926,0.089814815,MI

I'm giving this 5 stars because, in my opinion, unlike many short stories, this one didn't fall short or feel lacking in any way, other than I wish it were longer because it was so good.Will Fraser and Lissie Charteris are two weeks away from their wedding day and everything is wonderful. They&#8217;re madly in love and their sex life is sizzling hot.

Until Lissie gets a phone call from her relationship jaded mother who begins filling her head with doubts about whether she and Will are really in love, or if they&#8217;re merely in lust. Suddenly worried that they are doomed to end up unhappy like her parents did, Lissie suggests to Will&#8212;under the guise of experiencing an old fashioned romance&#8212;that the abstain from sex until after they are married, which leads to some funny, frustrating and incredibly hot scenes and kept the story interesting and moving at a fast pace.Keep in mind, Heaven Can't Wait is not a romantic suspense as is the rest of the I-Team series. This is just a glimpse into Will Fraser's happily ever after and a feel good read. I truly love Pamela Clare&#8217;s full length novels and the way she gives us characters who are real, whose actions, reactions and emotions are convincing.

The book however is very clear and a wonderful read for those that truly love God and understand how deep His love is for us. If you don't understand, read it anyway. You might gather some insight about His love for you.GENRE: Inspirational fiction.SETTING: Modern day Michigan; SpringCENTRAL MALE CHARACTERS: Collin is an English teacher. His sorrow has caused him to walk away from God. Daveny is a landscape architect with a vibrant personality and love for God.SYNOPSIS: He cannot get over the loss of his brother and naturally blames God. When he drops some material off at the church he used to attend, their eyes meet. Why is he the only one in his family that never attends worship? Why is she so full of life and captivating while drawing him in with the beauty of her personality?SEXUAL EXPLICITNESS: This book is Inspirational and a few gentle kisses are as explicit as it gets. YA wonderful. Adult inspiring.WHAT I LIKED: The reality of romance as a man and a woman grow to love one another. The feeling of real life.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: Moving forward and leaving behind a love that once was. I felt the characters should have interacted in a deeper way with regards to a past love. It seemed to have been shoved aside.I give this book (5) stars because I cried. You think that you have problems? Me also. Therefore but for the grace of God go WE.

1027,1027,"Wow! That is all I can say after finishing this book. It is not just a journey of two people falling in love but it is also a roller coaster emotional ride.We first met the heroine as that reliable big sister who always comes to the rescue of her more beautiful yet flighty sister. Yet she is not that usual emotional doormat, instead she has a strong core inside all her vulnerabilities. Her first meeting with the hero though is one of a kind. I guess I can laugh since I was not in her place but it was really a memorable one.The hero, on the other hand, is that tortured-soul, strong, alpha hero. To the author's credit, his presentation is not morbidly dark yet his suffering very evident. The mysteries of his life are cleverly dole out - as needed - without information dump.Of the two main characters, the heroine is the one who is more emotionally stable, grounded and strong. Her character, however, fits the hero's without making her weak and doormat.Though their meeting started as a practical necessity for both of them, life has other plans for them. It's not a `lust-at-first-sight' which made their HEA stronger and believable for me. We clearly see at the beginning that the hero is carrying a heavy burden and is determined to keep the heroine at arms length for both their sake anticipating the agreed upon end of their marriage. It was something to see them dance around each other as they fight their deepening attraction. The hero's goodbye to the heroine as he leaves for the warzone is done in a way that shows of his kicking and screaming heart unwilling to go down without a fight. And that is pretty much what he was doing since even after he came home because of an injury.I admire the heroine's determination to keep her promises especially amidst the hot and cold treatment from the hero. But when the hero finally took his head off the sand, I loved the way he wooed back his wife. A tad too easy for my taste but in this case it is signature `action speaks louder' and in their situation, it fits.I love the story. I don't think my review gives it justice. It is a book for every romance reader, story driven rather sex, and it is definitely a keeper.",1,1,0.586363636,0.862121212,MI

Been through several Cat. 3's, so, this was up my alley.This hurricane is expertly described. The characters are perfect for their respective roles. The action is non-stop. And...the plot is on the money.The premise of this story could actually come from the headlines about today's politics, since many sneaky things go on behind closed doors as power is sought by greedy men. However, I like the main characters and their desire to see right win over evil. This is one of those novels you can't put down until the solid ending releases you.I'm expecting a sequel to this one...no need to let three, possibly four great characters sit on the bench.

When Meg turns out to be pregnant, he elopes with her and they marry. He only tells Bree after, and then only by phone. By sheer coincidence Bree was going to tell Troy she was pregnant herself. Instead she left town, but lost the baby at three months pregnant.Present day and Bree has returned home for her sisters wedding. Of course she runs into Troy. Who had lost Meg in a road traffic accident fours years before. But he berates Bree for not attending the funeral. After all both he and Meg had apologised.Troy never knew about Bree's pregnancy or miscarriage, she never told him.What a shambolic mess this story is. The reader is never shown anything that happened in the past. All we get are small remembered snippets of conversations. The main story that is set in the present is weak, very little happens. The characters are shallow and self absorbed. I found it very difficult to relate to them in any way. Nothing happens except Troy constantly blames Bree for leaving town, and he can't understand why Bree who was madly in love with him wouldn't want to hang round and watch him play happy ever after with her best friend. As for Bree she should have told him she was pregnant. It might have made this a more interesting tale. And just to top it all off, Bree's father tells her that when Meg got pregnant he was the one who told Troy to marry her. But then as her father was a cheater himself what else can you expect.

Hero feels since they are already married, might as well have a ""normal"" society marriage, where after she delivers the heir, they lives their separate lives.

She writes about a touchy subject that a lot of prudes don't realize exists-erotic romance. In this series a group of three brothers brought up in a household where their Mom was together with their three Dads follow in their Dad's footsteps and also fall in love with one woman. The depth and emotion of Maya's characters are what makes these books so memorable. I have been reading erotic romances since they first starting becoming popular at Ellora's Cave and Kensington Publishing. I know that if I am reading one of Maya's books then it will be well developed with characters that grow and touch my heart. There will be explicit sexual scenes but they are tastefully done and improve the story not make up the story. This short story seems like most of it was sexual, but that is because this is a finalization to a series of 3 books. If you had read the first three books, then you would see how the family progressed and how the last generation of boys met and feel in love with their ""wife"".

1061,1061,"Colters' Wife (Colter's Legacy #1.5) by Maya Banks is a sequel to Maya's most popular book, Colters' Woman where three brothers all share the same woman and end up ""marrying"" her. I haven't read Colters' Woman since I'm not a big fan of siblings involved in a polyamorous incestuous relationship regardless if the siblings aren't sexually attracted to one another. In Colters' Wife, each Colter brother has one-on-one time with the pregnant heroine, Holly. There's no threesomes or quartet loving going on here.Colters' Wife goes as follows: Pregnant woman has sex with three brothers at different times, falls down a ditch, gives birth, The End. The sex was hot but there really wasn't much of a plot.When Holly fell down the ditch, I was expecting some Lassie type dog to run and get help. Unfortunately, no lovable dog appeared, and because of this I had to lower the grade because nothing says happily ever after like a woman married to three brothers and a pet dog they can all love and cherish. But then the dog wouldn't be able to sleep in their bed because there's no room with three brawny men and one small woman sleeping together.If you're a fan of Maya's Coulter series, you'll enjoy this short. It's both cheesy and equally disturbing having three brothers sharing one woman. Holly must be exhausted from all the Colter loving she gets.

On a mission, she snoops until she eventually stumbles upon John's little secret, his explicit phone conversations.THOUGHTSSlippery when wet, perfect wording for this novella. This would definitely go in the category of (try-sexual); if you're adventurous, then try it. In this novella, you experience a couple's sexual fantasies and awakenings floats to the surface. Being a frustrated wife trying to communicate with her husband to open up about his fantasies, Tara definitely learns a few things and did a few things that she wouldn't normally do. With the help of her best friend Kelly, things become a bit more interesting. Though this was an enjoyable read, I didn't care much for the storyline. The story was written in Tara's POV, and with a story such as this, I surely wanted to know what John was thinking at certain points in the story. With Tara's POV in focus, that causes me to feel how Tara felt, frustrated.  I also found that some of John's actions got me a little upset. Nevertheless, with the story's kinkiness and sexual escapades found within (95%) ninety-five percent of the book, erotica readers will not be disappointed.This book contains explicit fantasies, graphic sexual m/f/f scenes, which includes m/f/f grouping mixtures.Length: 2004 / 118 pagesStoryline:  FAIREnjoyment:  GOODIntimacy Level:  D.R.I.P (don't read in public) / VERY SPICY",1,1,0.667774086,0.8338870429999999,NJ

Ms.Kitt does well with this theme.  I just wish it was longer....or part of a series of short stories in order to fully understand both of the ladies as well as develop this theory of the feud.

1083,1083,"This M/M erotic romance sports a lot of assets:- it has a nice, elaborated, character-driven plot that is always compelling, except perhaps halfway through when Josh meets Julian again. Tension slacks in those pages but it takes off again after a little while. I would have appreciated it if the author had made more use of the work-setting of the characters but the story is complete as it is.- its characters are exotic enough (musicians and actors) to be more interesting than average people but they are also fully rounded, likeable and make one wish one could meet them in real life (at least I wish I could meet Josh, Corey and Travis, I really do). My only issue is about Josh and Corey being 24 when they clearly need to be closer to 30 to be entirely consistent with their behaviour and thoughts.- sex scenes are many, raunchy and very sexy. They are very sexy not because they are unbelievably well written (though they ARE well written) but because one always gets the feeling the people involved care deeply for each other and that is sexy in itself.Reading the blurb and a couple of pages in the first half I worried a little. Authors (especially lady-authors, truth to be told) have this pervasive fetish for dominance and submission. They do like to put their gay characters into tight little boxes, filing some as strong-dominant-active (and usually big and brawny) and others as conflicted-submissive-passive (and usually lean and blond and boyish). Some go so far as to transform erotica into something frankly unhealthy where the need to be dom/sub goes beyond the wall of the bedchamber. A selected few even try to pass on the idea that rape and enslavement are sexy...At first I thought Mr River was bound to follow that unfortunate path.There are a couple of pages at the beginning, when Travis debates his own feelings with himself, that had me cringe because he seems to be willing to relinquish control permanently to Corey. I do not know whether the author changed his mind halfway through or had it planned from the start but luckily things change. The BDSM element is relevant and shown explicitly but it remains just that: a kink that is part of the characters' sex life but is not all encompassing. BDSM being just a nice little game, it is sexy to read those kinky scenes.AND the lovers here are all versatile, thank goodness for (not so) small favours!- the love story is incredibly satisfying. Travis and Corey fall in love a little too fast and I presume the author could have devised a way to have them get to it more slowly but other than that the whole of it is incredibly heart-warming.- writing is neat and fluid. The POV shifts between the three leads from chapter to chapter and sometimes the same scene is seen again through different eyes which is not entirely new a device but it can work well if well used.There are no typos but grammar is faulty at times. Nothing too bad or evident but this work could use a revision which should also take care of a couple of mistakes in characters' names: Corey becomes Cody and Julian Jules. Characters break the fourth wall often which is fine as the author manages to give an individual voice to each. Only here and there the characters describe things they cannot possibly know, for example I remember Travis saying ""...my eyes smoldering..."" but there are several other examples of this mistake in logic.That said this is a nice, romantic read I can only recommend. But, please, someone change the model on the cover...",1,1,0.578171091,0.8312684359999999,NJ
1084,1084,"""Wild Horses"" is lean, tightly written, and very sexy; but also very well plotted and replete with the sort of deep emotional content that makes it a very satisfying read. It is one of those gay erotic novels that makes me think about the potential of the whole genre. It is a romance, it is surely erotic; but the three key characters whose story this is are vivid, interesting, and likeable. They are not stereotypes, they are not impossibly perfect; they're real guys, and River brings you into their lives. In the world of fledgling TV actors and up-and-coming rock bands, it's all about performance.This is not just smut; it is a heartfelt love story with a startling twist that left me hungry to know more about Corey, Travis, and Josh. Indeed, if I had any complaint at all to voice, it's that I would have loved to have more back story about each of the characters and how their past experiences led them to where they ended up. We get beautifully rendered sketches of the three main characters--River is extremely skilled at weaving their personalities into the narrative--but I finished the book wanting to know them even better: I wanted finished portraits with all the details.I know that River has a new book on the say; can't wait to read it.",1,1,0.583657588,0.514267186,NJ
1085,1085,"Krylov is the only writer I've encountered who can overwrite in an efficient and tight manner. I absorb her prose with green eyes. Beyond her grasp of the craft, she exceeds at character psychology. This is a biting tale of a girl's internal struggle with her captivity, her abductor's compelling point of view, and a discovery of desire. A twisted ride overran with perversions, stomach-flinging terror, and surprisingly warm sensuality. I sank so deep into the mental complexity of the situation, I lost the ability to interpret my moral compass",1,1,0.653846154,0.851648352,NJ
1086,1086,"Picture the male prison system and the sexual hierarchy within. Now remove the guards, throw in a beautiful virginal girl, and roll the cameras. This isn't the usual doomsday story where survival is defined by food hoards and weaponry skills. It is a dissection of non-consent sexuality and the ugliest human emotion: Fear. The fear that destroys a mother when her baby is ripped from her arms. The fear that consumes a twelve-year girl when she sees a man for the first time in her life. The fear that weakens boys as they mature into the kind of men who raised them, never knowing what it feels like to touch and be touched without pain. Part 1, the back story with the heroic virgin, leaves a permanent scar branded with terror, disappointment, and inspiration. It was such an incredibly potent set up for Part 2, the aftermath twenty plus years later. What I found most compelling was the courageous honesty between the scared, and the scary, cast of survivors. There was very little to smile about in this story, and I wouldn't recommend it to the mainstream reader. It represents the worst of mankind, the monster that lies in wait, springing with the right measurement of nature and nurture. Yet, as Krylov brutally showed these monsters cold and merciless, she also showed their tears. And when you taste these tears, you feel their humanity. It was hideous and beautiful. I began this book with a bias since Krylov is one of favorite authors. I ended it feeling dilated and awe-struck. The downside to reading such an powerful tale is knowing that the books I read its wake will fall short. This story will haunt my waking thoughts and chase me in my slumber for a very long time.

1088,1088,"Jointly reviewed for : [...]Gitte: I am sat here Jenny and I actually have no idea how or where to start this review, it was just so different to anything I have read in a long while. It was a hard read, and it hurt. It hurt so much that at times I wanted to put it down, but I just couldn't.To be honest, this book is certainly not for everyone. It will definitely push boundaries for some readers. In particular; readers who are or have been personally affected by breast cancer.This story, I can imagine, would be very painful and tough in respect to the main themes, which are control and fear. Control of our lives, our bodies and our minds. Control of others.  Fear of what is to come or what will be and of what we have left behind and can be no more. Fear of others.I cried so many times reading this book that I lost count. But I remember exactly why I cried, how I felt, how at times I had to catch my breath and no doubt about it this story will stay with me for a long long time.Now, because of the emotions it drew out of me, because I felt a lump in my throat through every page turn, because of these three broken, vulnerable yet somehow strong and inspirational characters; Galen, Vanka & Khalid.......I have to give it 5 stars, I can't not.It is so very dark, so very heart breaking, so very intense....so very REAL.It is also extremely erotic yet not always `comfortable to read erotica'. Sometimes it made for uncomfortable reading when control and fear was brought into the equation of three.The writing of this Author is brilliant; no doubt about it, her heart is stamped on every single page. Leaving behind a journey that is so raw and `ugly' yet so beautiful; so very devastating yet hopeful and inspiring.Jenny:  I agree Gitte.  Because of the sheer scale of feelings I encountered reading this book and the fact that it evoked such strong emotions in me, how can I not rate it highly.  I too have sat here wondering how I can best convey my thoughts about this book and it is difficult.  Unlike you, I actually did put this book down at 40% and thought I couldn't continue.  It was killing me.  I was just so......unbearably sad reading it.Breast Cancer is very raw for me and this was written from a place which felt so incredibly real, a little too uncomfortably real for me at times, but I sat myself down and I didn't move until I finished.  This book was so much more than what I originally expected it to be, so very much more.I ached and cried, and whilst I can't say I ""enjoyed"" this read, I can say I am so grateful I pushed through because I was afforded such an amazing reading experience, one that will stay with me for a long time to come , you don't forget a book like this in a hurry and even now I can't stop thinking about it.This m&eacute;nage book  took me way out of my comfort zone at times that's for sure.  Some scenes were hard to read,  be it based on the theme or the sex partially based at times on fear, dominance and control did force me to push through my levels of comfort but it was absolutely worth every minute.The characters moved me to the ninth degree.  The determined, pragmatic Vanka who is convinced she is dying.  Galen, the movie star who appears to have it all, yet feel s his life is a shallow illusion.  Khalid, beautiful Khalid who has known so much tragedy in life and can only know love through hurt.These characters broke my heart, they seared my soul.  Theirs is not always a happy journey, in fact at times it is downright sad as you experience their desolation, but it is one that will crush your heart as it did mine, but there are also glimpses of light and times of tenderness that will steal your breath away.Gitte: We all want to find the power of the three's; peace, love and happiness. It's a clich&eacute; but we do, however life's randomly thrown obstacles do not make this an easy journey. The path and the obstacles unique to the individual, not presented exactly as we perhaps may have expected or believed.A chance meeting between three people whose lives become interwoven, who each seek in each other something different; to heal them, to give them strength to show them trust and teach them how. To embrace fear and to understand that life and love is fragile. The thread that holds lives together and ties one to the other can easily be frayed, broken and torn by the all-encompassing HURT.Vanka, Galen & Khalid broke my heart. Each for their own individual reasons. Their personal journeys in this story so different, yet all three entwined.This is not a pretty soft story wrapped up in shiny layers and a sparkling bow. Well on the surface it is not. Rather, it is a raw and gritty, sharp and multi sharp angled story wrapped up in barbed wire. Once you unravel the layers that hurt and cut you deep, you are amazed by the vulnerability, the love, the compassion and theIf you willingly relinquish control or if control is taken away from you.....What are you left with?If you live in perpetual fear or force it upon yourself.....Where do you go from there and how far are you willing to go?Jenny: This story about chance meeting, fate, destiny, pain and heartache was so profoundly moving, touching and at times disturbing in its themes and uncomfortable in the erotic sexual MMF content, but it was also brilliantly written and so compelling from start to finish that I found this wasn't just a read, but more like an experience.Galen, so intuitively in sync with Vanka rendered me breathless in some scenes.  This man could show such tenderness, compassion, and sensitivity and could care for Vanka and her needs with an unyielding kindness, yet in other ways could be somewhat cruel, so closed off.""You look.........."" Galen came up short.  Speechless.  Possibly a first.""Stunning?"" She prompted. ""Fabulous?""""Ethereal."" He finally said, his voice a little choked.Vanka, so guarded and closed, stoic, selfless and suffering through an unimaginable experience, trying to make sense of life and thinking of the ones she will leave behind.""I can take care of myself.  I have to be able to take care of myself.""""Not all the time. Not now""The relationship between Khalid and Galen was the one I found the saddest and hardest to read.  Theirs was such a complicated story and the beautiful Khalid...so patient, so loving, yet so hurt who only wanted to feel and know love.It is the coming together of all three, the hurt and the pain they all share and the comfort they bring one another, how they could all serves one another's needs.""Most people are in love with more than one person during their lifetime.""""Or they don't admit it when it happens""This book will not appeal to everyone and as I've said I did find it hard going at times,  but I would implore you to pick up a copy of Hurt and give it a go,  because this an experience like no other.",1,1,0.585774059,0.689330544,NJ

Writing of this quality is unusual in taboo erotica.The story starts off a little cheesy -- sister catches her brother masturbating and makes him show her.

1090,1090,"Well, I am giving this book 4 stars because this author is a gifted writer. I hesitated to read this at first. I purchased Abduction and then Lost showed up in my recommendations. I read the description and I was disgusted as most are when they read it. Then I decided to see what others were saying about it. Most reviewers said that the writing was excellent and the story was disturbing, but understandable under the circumstances. I have to agree. This is a very disturbing read, so if you can't handle a very intense story, do not purchase this book. You really need to know where your limits are before reading this story.It is a short story, thank god because toward the end I'd had enough. Things had gotten beyond my ability to take it.A father, son and daughter are stranded on an island doing research. When they were first stranded the daughter was 15 years old. Three years later is where the story really begins. Things happen that make you wonder what you would do in a situation like this. This author is an excellent writer because she had me thinking, thinking and thinking about human sexuality. For some reason, I was reminded of Eve and the apple in the garden of Eden. I think it helped in my mind that Cat (the sister) was the one pursing the brother not the other way around. If he were the the one trying to engage, I think I would have been disgusted and thought of him as a rapist. I know, double standards, its wrong but I think I was able to take the story better this way.I liked the brother because he tried his best to refrain from the behavior that was being handed to him, but in the end his primal urges could not resist. The temptation was too great. I didn't blame him and I was surprised at myself. In my mind, I was thinking, he tried his best, and he really did deserve to be happy under those terrible circumstances. I really didn't focus too much on the fact that this was a brother/sister incest situation, but in the end I was focused on the father/daughter scenario. I didn't like it and was glad it happened at the end of the book.Again, I say, know your limits before reading this. This book is intense.",1,1,0.571428571,0.892857143,NJ

I say ""may not want to read"" because this book is so very well written and beautifully done that I would encourage my friends to try it out.Lost will push your comfort zone with full on incest between brother and sister and daughter and father in an environment and under circumstances that are believable. It will make you question yourself. When placed in a survival situation, what could we become. I am reminded of Lord of the Flies. What would we do when stripped to our baser animalistic desires and no longer restrained by societal expectations. When lost from society for too long, would we then lose ourselves, lose our way? I believe that is what happened to Victor, Cat and Derrick. They were not just physically lost. Once they lost their morality (truly lost their way) they no longer cared about being rescued.

1103,1103,"I was putting off getting a light for my Kindle 3 Keyboard because I mainly read with lights on and didnt think I had the need. I had kept one on my wish list since I bought ny kindle, in case I decided to buy it. Lately, I have been reading in the family room at night where there isn't much light except for a bright one on the ceiling fan, so I decided now was the time to get that light. Of course, before ordering I looked up other lights to see if there was anything new and/or better. Turns out there is. The Belkin Clip-ON Reading Light for Kindle is more money than the other light,but it has a smaller front to the clip, so it doesnt block the face of the Kindle. I read through most of the reviews and noticed there was a lot of concern about it fitting my size Kindle. I saw the little add-on clip they made for Kindle keyboards, and wondered if that would really work. I was not sure if I should bother if I was going to end up returning it, but Amazon is great with customer service and I knew that the worst case would be I returned it and got the other one.My Belkin Clip-On Reading Light came today and the first thing I did was insert the 3 AAA batteries needed. The light has 2 settings, but I find the lower setting is sufficient enough for me. The light itself is very lightweight and the batteries do not make it much heavier. Now it was time to try the fit. I use a rubber protective ""skin"" on my Kindle, so placing the light on it did not require the use of the add-on. The skin makes it grip tight enough that it doesn't fall off, even turning it upside down. (believe me,I tested this out) It does stick out a bit in the back (why 4 starts istead of 5), but it stays in place and it is not like I will be running around while reading. When I tuck the light into the base, it is small enough to fit inside the front zippered part of my Kindle case. Overall, it will do the job it is made for and that's what counts. I am not crazy about the price for such a small light, but I feel somethings are worth paying a little extra for.",1,1,0.578021978,0.36703296700000004,NJ

Since I've read all the books in this series I am grateful for these short stories to keep me going until the next book comes out.""Cold Case"" deals with the untimely death of a young child. I usually never read stories about a child being harmed but this author was able to avoid the usual pitfalls of a story like this and use it instead to delve into the deepest paranormal experiences of Jeff Resnick.Jeff, in this story, knows from the get go that the little boy will not be coming home. Rather than dwell on the heart break of a Mother's loss, Jeff follows his paranoraml instincts and wanders where his spirit leads him. The author brings us into the intensity of Jeff's ""gift' by helping us to understand that he not only empathizes with the Mother...he absorbs her feelings. I believe this is what may also bring on his migraine headaches resulting in Jeff's becoming ill in the neighbor's apt.I don't want to give away too much of this story and ruin the pleasure of anyone planning on reading this story so...let me just say that you will not be disappointed by this journey into Jeff's paranormal abilities. Each book in this series and each short story is a journey that I am experiencing with Jeff.

I ordered the paperbook version, and it took much longer than expected. He actually sent me an e-copy of it to make up for this. So I now have 2 versions of it and I am one happy customer.So after all this trouble, it could have been a disappointing flop. After all, it is a bit of a risky concept anyway. Writing a book in one sitting, about various subjects, some trivial and some serious. It could have been a load of rubbish. I am very glad to be able to say it was definitely worth the wait.I really found myself entering into the spirit of the thing. I was talking back to him as if he could hear me. (under my breath of course - i'm not stupid!). Not that it was all sweetness and light though. At several points I was, let's say, a bit uncomplimentary about what he had written, and its a good thing he couldn't hear me. Other bits were very funny and some bits got a 'Yeah, me too!' But isn't that what a conversation is all about? I did think about writing a few answers to him, but the moment has passed now, and I'm not that good a writer.I liked that he put some real-life sections into it, instead of just making it frothy entertaining bits. Thats what made it a real conversation (if a bit one-sided). It reminded me of a couple of lines of a song written years ago by a friend of mine: 'Running through the winter snow, in just your socks and shades/ rewind the video, of all your best mistakes.' Some things keep on haunting you, and writing them in a book is as good a way as any of taking away some of the sting.",1,1,0.549597855,0.47453083100000004,NJ

1123,1123,"It's been six months but I remember buying this book because I'd seen a semi-positive review on a blog--Dear Author probably--and because a romance of a mixed-race couple in the 1860's Wild West sounded intriguing. Especially since neither character is white.Unfortunately the story didn't live up to its promise.I did like the start of the book, although I did think it somewhat boring. The author spends a lot of time setting the scene and describing the life of a Chinese worker building the railroads for a pittance and the life of a black single woman trying to build a new life and a business for herself and her friend. Bias, racism, sexism, it's all there and prevalent in the vernacular.As if that's not enough to create obstacles to the couple's happiness, there's also their inability to fully understand each other. Quiang speaks but a little English and he and Leah have to communicate through gestures, looks, and touches.There's all this, and what does the author do with it? Nothing. Cullars glosses over all the difficult--and rewarding--steps of a meaningful relationship building and focuses on the paper thin physical attraction instead. There's a brief mention of how Leah and Quiang learn to communicate with the help of a dictionary, but they don't really talk to each other. When they're together they're either taking their clothes of and having sex or putting their clothes on and thinking about having sex. And those sex scenes are bad. There's creaming and there's tumescence, there's orbs and there's the infamous ""her sex"" euphemism.After all that, the story and my rating for it could have been saved had I bought Quiang's interactions with the triad members. I can't really pinpoint my problem with them, but something in the language used left me unconvinced. It wasn't just Wao's refusal to call an erection an erection, it was also how the revelation of the misappropriation was handled. Until then, I had liked Quiang's willingness to engage in shady businesses for quick profit and that both characters had such defined lives outside each other, after it just felt anticlimactic.I didn't want a happily ever after epilogue, I wanted to read how they get there.So what does the book have? Good historical description with nascent characterisations, but without any real character or relationship development, and a whiff of Wild West adventures. It simply wasn't enough for me.",1,0,0.582795699,0.037927664,NJ

She has scars left over from surgeries because of a childhood deformity and it's affected her outlook on life and about herself. Compared to others who have suffered from the same issue she knows she should feel `lucky' since her scars aren't that noticeable. She uses sarcasm as a barrier to keep people at a distance. While waiting tables she meets this guy `Lucky' and they develop a sweet relationship. What starts off as a friendship slowly turns into something more. Lucky doesn't see what Beth sees in herself.

He focuses on all the good whereas she has a hard time seeing anything but what she perceives as flaws.Lucky is a freshman in college and he's there because of a soccer scholarship. He makes a stupid decision that affects their relationship and since this is such a short story it would be hard to say much more without giving away a spoiler.

She had a harsh childhood which makes her very guarded as an adult.  Her fear to launch into a relationship with the magnetic and rich Devon Campbell is totally understandable.  She is weary of his intentions, and although you don't learn about all the things she went through in her childhood and even some of her experiences as an adult, you learn enough about her character to really care for her.  I thought she was wonderfully developed.  Devon Campbell was a dreamy guy and worthy as a romantic hero.  His character didn't feel as fully developed as Mari's, but he was her knight in shining armor.  It's surprising that he had such a crush on Mari in high school, but sometimes people can make an impression without even knowing it.

The novel is used to show the plight of single mothers and many of the difficulties that they face both in the work environment and in society at large. (i.e. enduring abusive relationships, lack of money, the responsibilities that go with rearing children in one-parent families etc.)Robyn Carr does a great job of utilizing her writing skills and talent to make others aware of the less fortunate. She does so in this easy-to-read, short novel by sharing the endearing story of the main character, Dory Finn. By describing her situation, the author is able to educate her reading audience in a creative and inspirational way. Therefore, this light romance novel is a ""feel good"" book as it spices up the plot with a little love story. At the same time, it also shows the combined efforts of several people as they work together toward a common goal for a great cause!",1,1,0.6261682239999999,0.732977303,TX

As other reviewers have commented, I found this book to be very similar in style to Georgette Heyer's works (I consider GH among the best of authors in this genre.)  I would say if you enjoyed the adventuresome plot in the Corinthian, you will likely enjoy The Mudlark.  I fell immediately in love with the characters, the storyline was fast paced and I very much enjoyed the author's fine turn of phrase.  The fact of the matter is that I liked this book so much I read it in one sitting as I could not tear myself away from the story in my eagerness to find out what would happen next.

Her books are well-written, with witty dialogue, interesting plots, and lots of passion, even without explicit sex scenes.The Mudlark is a full length historical romance. Tristan, the future Viscount of Stuffiness, and Izzy, the adorable AccidentWaitingToHappen, are thrown together by their fathers, the Drunken Duo, in expectations of a perfect match. So naturally, our horrified couple fall madly into  loathe-at-first-sight, and hatch an intricate plan to get rid of each other.

I have known many people with mental illnesses (depression, bipolar, anxiety, schizoaffective disorder, PTSD) and none of them are violent. Are some people with mental illness violent? Of course, but not to the degree to what is portrayed in the media.With all the violence in our society, the media and politicians often state that the violent criminals are mentally ill. Not so, and I think thats a dangerous assumption because it ignores the predominant reasons why people are violent, and thus skews finding out how to prevent it.

1153,1153,"How do you flush out a traitor who can mask their identity and even hide their scent from a wolves sensitive sense of smell? Well, when the former Alpha is a psychotic madman who resorts to all kinds of dark magic to destroy the Westervelt Werewolves and their mates, then an invisible traitor becomes the next logical spy in his sadistic plans.After fending off an attack with a demon and now self-exiled to hide his darker side from his pack members, scarred and tortured Theo Kane (half brother to the Alpha, Tristan Kane) soon finds that his mate is the new head of security, Faith Anderson.Rebecca Royce is a shining star with this action filled and fast paced story between werewolves Theo and Faith. Ms. Royce continues to impress with her engaging writing of wolf-shifter adventures. Her fictional world development is both believable and fascinating. I keep finding myself searching for wolf traits in my personality half-believing I might be a long lost shifter at heart. I have grown to love this series and look forward to each new saga.Dream-mystic Faith discovers her wolf side quite by accident when a forced shifting takes place in Mexico. She's finally able to set her wolf free by working security detail on the island that has been calling for her return for many years. What a shock it is to Faith to discover not only that there is another Kane brother on the island but that he's her predestined mate.Soon Theo and Faith find themselves working together to flush out the enemy among them. Despite the physical and mental repercussions they both have had to endure, you'll love how these two lovers secure their happiness before the wolf-shifters are all destroyed.Ms. Royce has discovered the secret of writing her werewolf creations in such away to express their dual natures when ultimately they are one and the same-being. I love the witty dialogue and banter between the simplistic thinking wolf and it's emotional charged human counterpart. I find this unique and enjoyable.I suggest anyone interested in this series to start from the beginning as each story is riveting and exciting; however I'm impressed with how each book covers enough background material to insure it can be a stand alone novel.This particular story, though furthering the drama of the werewolves fate, focuses mostly on Faith and Theo and their lives, their past and how to unlock the mysteries that ultimately will decide their futures. I have really enjoyed the fact that these two characters accepted each other at the beginning of the tale and found themselves working together as a team to solve the drama of discovering who has betrayed them. The secondary characters are insightful and informative. You can feel the sense of evil in the development of this serial making this paranormal realm invigorating and thrilling. Each new addition to the Westervelt Wolves series entices us with a nibble of upcoming exploits making one anticipate reading about the Kane brothers, their new mates and the battle between good and evil.Looking for an enchanting fable with scintillating and enigmatic plots, a sense of family unity, and a succulent romance that engages your imagination and satisfies your sense of adventure? Then Wolf Reborn might be the book you have been searching for.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews",1,1,0.588435374,0.670748299,SC

Many father's had served in war, witnessing death and destruction firsthand, asked to perform impossible tasks, always living in harms way and then surviving that part of your life.  Many had prayed to their God during that time, setting pacts and negotiating for things in the future. Surviving the war without shedding blood doesn't necessarily mean that a person is unscathed.  Those invisible wounds have brought down the strongest of soldiers over time, many feeling guilty for not dying with their friends, causing them to suffer a life of guilt and despair.Now your daughter enlists into the military and is deployed to Iraq. You worry about her and feel helpless that you are unable to protect her. How far would you go?  What are your options?

Yes, they were short, but I knew they were short. The writing was done very well, with no mistakes that I could find, but then again I was enthralled by the story and not looking for them. I don't have a lot of time anymore to read and so I do it before going to bed. I started in on this story, and was still reading a couple hours later with my eyes burning. I couldn't put the book down. The only thing that prevented me from giving this book a 5 star was the ending. I needed more.

To me, that just defies the workings of the natural mind.Forgiveness is one thing but practically condoning the (brave) actions of the Japanese guards and their superiors was a bit insulting.Can you imagine someone stating how brave the Nazis were when they led their victims to the crematoriums?I found this book to be a difficult read at best.",1,0,0.5524861879999999,0.20883977899999998,FL
1169,1169,"If you've ever lived in or been to Iowa, then this title ought to catch your attention quickly, as it did me. I found that the view of Iowa was a bit stereotypical, and during the three years I lived there, I didn't really run into the sort of stock characters that O'Guinn littered his story with (that may be because I was in a college town, however small it may be, and so it tended to be more liberal). However, despite the fact that I found O'Guinn guilty of perpetuating these small-town-people stereotypes, I really enjoyed the story.Collin was perhaps the most amusing main character that I've ever come across, because he seemed so oblivious to the fact that he was so transparent with people--especially his family. I would definitely describe his narrative as a coming-of-age story, which will attract some people and repel others. The angst that can often be found in these types of stories still exists with Exiled to Iowa, but it is dampered by the humor and wit of Collin's personality, so it's easy to appreciate the trials he faces as a gay kid in a foreign (and small) land.If you like witty comedy and lovable characters , this book is definitely worth a shot.",1,1,0.579831933,0.579831933,FL

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started to read Shield but beyond expecting something on a par with A More Deserving Blackness I was open to anything.I imagine this would be classified as a NA novel but it is head and shoulders above just about everything else I've read in the genre (as is A More Deserving Blackness) that it nearly transcends NA entirely.The characters, Lilly, Miller, Monica, Ann, Chris and rest are well drawn, clearly defined and deeply detailed in description, dialogue, and action. The love scenes are practically chaste in their language and description but some of the most moving and deeply emotional that I've read in a long time. I think this is due, in large part, to the fact that the characters have time to develop deep feelings for each other and have more than begun to build their relationship before they become intimate. The characters and story line are too realistic to have them just fall into bed willy-nilly. That sort of thing works for novels that are so clearly fiction but not here, where it's so real.This is one I'll read again and again.Quick plot recap - Lilly and Miller are part of a crew of volunteers rehabbing a warehouse to turn it into a shelter for homeless families in a Philadelphia suburb.

1183,1183,"I have to say that this romance involved aspects that I particularly detest...namely infidelity.  Shortly after Arabella and James are married, he abandons her in the country, seemingly for the delights of London.  Two years later he returns home to claim his wife and his husbandly rights.  Arabella, of course, is not happy about James' return.  James' absence is ultimately explained and forgiven, even by this reader.  However, I hate infidelity of any kind, and in this story we are supposed to believe that even though Arabella loves her husband, she still felt free to carry on a clandestine sexual relationship with her father's land agent, Tom. She even went so far as to sleep with him just hours before going to her husband's bed.  The revelation of how Tom came to be in Arabella's life, did not, in my view, make the adultery any less unpalatable, especially when you consider the fact that Arabella had no idea how Tom came to work for her father.  Then there is the fact, that when James returns home he is accompanied by two women who are purportedly his mistresses...although that is never confirmed, he certainly did not deny it when Arabella accused him of such.  I didn't understand how I was  supposed to believe that James really loves his wife, and was sorry for everything that had occurred between them when, after a two year absence, he finally comes home accompanied by his MISTRESSES!!  Furthermore, when the story ends I was confused as to the future of the trio; were they all going to be in a relationship from then on, or was this m&eacute;nage a trois just a one time occurrence?  So, in my view, this book has really hot sex, but the actual story is confusing and unsatisfying.

1187,1187,"There's certain (sub-)genres I go into with high expectations. I have questions and I want answers. I want a specific thing told to me about what the genre is, it has to be believable, I want to be convinced on certain things but above that I want to be made to understand and believe them. Unfortunately, m&eacute;nages are at the top of that list. I need the story sold to me, to have it believable but it has to suck me in right from the beginning or there's no hope of redemption. That's a bit harsh, I know, and I'm sorry, but it's the way I feel with m&eacute;nages.With that said, this book frustrated me beyond belief. It didn't start off on a good note for me. The first 50% of the book is essentially just smut and for someone like me who prefers at least double the plot than smut, it was unbearable to get through. I was extremely close to calling this my first DNF but I agreed to stick it out until the half-way mark... Thankfully, the book finally caught my eye around that time (although it could have also been from the fact I cheated and skipped to certain parts of the book to see if I was actually wasting my time or not).Now, just to clarify, I'd say this book is made up of about 60-70% smut. Which I hated and resulted in me skipping those scenes. They were redundant, boring and unnecessary. Only a select few actually contributed to the story. The rest of it seemed like a page filler to me.It was hard for me to connect with the three MCs. For one, Luke, which is the only pov we get (in first person) is never actually described. So, I have no idea what he looks like and if he was described then I completely missed that because I don't remember any description about him regarding his appearances besides a reference to his father. Richard and Matthew, the other MCs, are perfectly described. But the thing is none of them know anything about each other. Like nothing. At ALL. They jumped into bed together at a club. Three times. Agree to go on a date. Still know nothing about each other. Then move in together. Still not knowing anything about each other. I didn't like it. Especially with the fact Luke didn't want to put Matthew or Richard into a situation of possibly getting hurt by his father but he still moved in with them when he knew his father would eventually find him and seek to make their lives a living hell. Yeah.....Anyway, so, yeah. I was frustrated throughout most of the book. To me, the relationship wasn't believable. I still don't understand their relationship. Yeah, at the end, you can tell they loved each other but it was made impossible for me to love them because there was no dialogue between them getting to know each other. What we know of them is what Luke gave us in brief summaries of what he learned from their 'dates'. Well, I wanted to actually experience those dates. Instead, I got the smexing after the date.Needless to say, I didn't much like this book. I couldn't connect with the characters or their relationship, the smexing put me off so much from the start there was barely a chance of redemption for this story. With that said, I did appreciate Sloan Parker's writing. It drew me in when the smut didn't overpower the pages. That's what captured my attention and made me want to keep reading when all I wanted to do was complain about the book. I was ready to give up on it but then the smexing lessened slightly and her words drew me in. The conflict revolving around Luke's father was a bit cliched and unbelievable but it still made me stick with the story.Overall, I'm sorry, I can't recommend this book. I never connected with the characters. I still feel as if they don't really know each other and none of it was believable to me.",1,0,0.581772784,-0.209113608,FL
1188,1188,"I received a complimentary copy of this book from one of the authors in exchange for a fair and honest review.  I rated it 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed for TwoLips Reviews LLC4 1/2 kisses, 2 peppers-group sex scenes, anal sex, sex with aliens, neck bitingEarthly Pleasure by BJ McCallRenee Tremaine, daughter of Zelda, house of Aasi, lives on Earth and provides sanctuary and healing to the legendary warriors who are injured while battling evil on the peaceful planets. Itan, son of Rane, house of Tanzer, is one of the legendary warriors. He is mildly injured and calls Prioress Renee to aid him and stay at the sanctuary while he heals. Renee doesn't know what comes over her. She's seen naked warriors before, but none has inflamed her like this one. He is so tall, so muscular, so everything. But she knows better than to get involved with a warrior. They leave and never return. Itan wants Renee to stay with him while he heals. Slowly he seduces her and starts to feel guilty over the secret he has kept from Renee. How will Renee act when she learns the secret Itan has kept from her?I really enjoyed Earthly Pleasure by BJ McCall. The story has a great plot that is very intriguing. Renee is a strong, confident woman who is alone, but learns to trust her feelings. She also feels somewhat betrayed by Itan, but quickly forgives him. These are all traits that I think make a perfect heroine. Itan is handsome, strong, and finds love where he least expects it. A great hero in my opinion.Erotic Sacrifice by Cynthia RayneBronwyn Steele feels her time for finding love is running out. So she decides to be the Carnal Sacrifice this year. The only man she has really thought she wanted was Gabriel Trueblood, but he doesn't know she's alive. Gabriel has desired Bronwyn for a long time, but for some reason hasn't acted on his feelings. It's time once again for the Carnal Sacrifice. A long time ago a deal was made between the demons and humans to keep the peace. After all, humans would be appalled to find out that demons lived among them. Certain female humans are chosen to sexually sacrifice themselves to The Dark Lord of the demons. Bronwyn is totally looking forward to her Carnal Sacrifice.Erotic Sacrifice was such a yummy story. I loved every word of it. Cynthia Rayne writes an extremely sizzling read with some unexpected outcomes. The characters are well written and defined, and the setting is very believable. I am so going to check out reading more from this author.Hot Under The Collar by Katie BluEmma Leeds owns and runs a bakery and has started donating day old bread to the church since the new preacher arrived. Reverend Eric Johns hasn't been able to take his eyes off Ms. Leeds when she comes to church. Emma is so sure she is going to hell for lusting after the new preacher. But she can't help it. He is so hot. After an embarrassing incident during a sermon, Rev. Johns asks Emma to his office. They engage is some of the most hot and steamy sex Emma has ever had. But this can't really be happening. After all, this man is a preacher!Hot Under The Collar was a clever and witty little story that had me laughing sometimes and gasping other times. Katie Blu writes a great book with an unexpected twist that this reader really enjoyed. Emma was so funny and so real. Eric's language sometimes made my jaw drop. But his character was right for Emma. I am still smiling as I write this review.Incensed by Kate HillCori Ricci is so mad she could spit. Her sister was engaged to the perfect man and now she has called off her engagement and is going to marry someone she just met. Cyril Stratton has been traveling all over for a long time and has finally decided to settle down and open his shop Soul Scents. He makes personal incense and can find soul mates through their scents. All Cori knows is that this man is a fraud and must be stopped and put out of business. But when Cori agrees to have her incense made, both Cyril and she are shocked to find who her soul mate is.What a totally clever book. Kate Hill writes a wonderful story with such an intriguing plot. Incensed is so unique, I know you will enjoy it as much as I did. Cori is self supporting and has given up a lot to raise her younger sister. I admire anyone who can put others ahead of themselves. Cyril seems so lonely and has a secret that has haunted him for years. I felt so bad for him I just wanted him to find some happiness.Making The Madam by Delilah DevlinMerry Winslow lost her husband and now her Aunt Millie. But Millie has left Merry Millie's Emporium. Not understanding why the lawyer is trying to get her to sell the business to someone, Merry feels she can run the Emporium. After all, how hard can it be to cut bolts of cloth? Nathan Boone, a rich playboy who frequents the Emporium, has an offer for Merry.I still have to chuckle at how nave Merry is. Making The Madam is a very short story, but not short on sex, or emotions. Merry is definitely shocked when she finds out what kind of business she owns. I like Merry's emotions; they felt real and true. Delilah Devlin does a nice job with Nathan's character. He is so sly. I wouldn't mind meeting a guy like Nathan. This is such a lighthearted and entertaining read.The Emissary by Jenna ReynoldsShina has been waiting for the day she will no longer be a virgin and can begin servicing clients. Her virgin auction should be soon. But a threat to all those in the Hegemony from an alien race called Kjartans may permanently delay her auction. When a head government official arrives at the house to arrange for a courtesan to service the alien, the most popular girl refuses. They then learn the alien prefers a virgin. Placing all hopes of keeping peace with the Kjartans, Shina is selected. She is afraid because no one has ever seen these aliens. The night of passion between Shina and the alien brings forth unintentional feelings.Jenna Reynolds has chosen an interesting setting for The Emissary, the customs and clothing of Japan. Shina was very brave in going through what was asked of her. I don't know if I could do that. I admired her determination and bravery. I loved the secret of the alien; it made me shiver with desire.I found all stories in the anthology Ellora's Cavemen: Jewel Of The Nile Vol 1 to be highly erotic page turners with strong characters and great settings.

1191,1191,"Gabriela Popa has discovered a transporting method of writing about the magic of being a child and seeing the world through the eyes of a child. In her words, `A few years after I came to US, after a long discussion with my American friends about life in Eastern Europe, I started writing a novel about what meant to be a child in communist Romania. I wanted to understand the child I once was, because I felt that that child held the key to my future. I wanted to understand what it meant to grow up there in the mid-sixties. How were my friends, my schoolmates, how was I able to figure out what was happening around us?  How did we distinguish between bad and good - when they were labeled chaotically?  How was it that we laughed a lot, as children?'  In KAFKA'S HOUSE Popa reveals a gift for writing that assures the reader from the first page that here is an artist who not only expresses herself well in a language that is so innocently childlike, but that she is about to give us all a view of how life in the Communist countries developed and influenced the thinking of the people - primarily through the developing eyes and thoughts of children who had not known life without dictatorship.This is a not a caustic novel, a book filled with disenchantment, a picture of a country degraded by the regime of Nicolae Ceau&#537;escu. This story is more related to the universal tales of the spectrum of growing up in an environment restrictive by both governmental decree and by low income living no matter where the house and child and school and events of a year take place.It would be difficult to imagine that the main character, the indefatigable Sylvia Cercu age 10, a little girl with a wild imagination, insisting on dreams coming true, curious enough to play at seeking God's assistance in gaining permission to attend a summer camp on the Black Sea in both an Orthodox Church and a Catholic Church, a little vixen unafraid to tease her fellow classmate Florin about his big banded ears as she is to try forbidden `medicine' stolen by her best friend Duck and yet equally as able to perform her child duties such as fetching the ingredients for her mother's soup - it is difficult to think that there is not a lot of Gabriela Popa revealed.So why the title of this book?  It is as simply explained as is the day to day life in Bacau, Romania and yet echoes the wisdom of the writer: Franz Kafka (1883 -1924) was a German-language writer of novels and short stories, born in Prague, whose themes included alienation, physical and psychological brutality, parent-child conflict, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformations.  We discover from Sylvia that Kafka lived in a tiny `restrictive' house in exotic Prague - a parallel in many ways, though on the level of a child, to Sylvia's existence. It is that sort of multiple levels of meaning that makes this little book so memorable. Originality of writing, depth of intelligence, and freshness of voice - these are the attributes of Gabriela Popa. Grady Harp, January 13",1,1,0.584589615,0.653824679,FL

1194,1194,"I have read other books by Rebecca Forster. I love her style, and the intrigue she puts into her characters and stories. But I will cry from the roof tops, Beyond Malice is one of the finest murder mysteries I have ever read!We start with the premise. It is the year 1892 in San Francisco, Walter Dimsdale and Franklin Morris establish a Law Partnership of Dimsdale and Morris. In 1906 the offices were leveled by earthquake, and they moved down to Los Angeles. Mott was brought on with the death of Dimsdale, and today Dimsdale Morris and Mott still is the legal name of the company, run by four Senior Partners, Oliver Hedding, Don Forrester, Peter Sweeney and Lucas Mallory.DM&M; hosted three glorious days called 'Retreat' where every one of the Partners both Senior, Junior and Associates, some secretaries and paralegals, mingled with their spouses to be `seen.'Nora Royce was a female lawyer being fast tracked to partner, her mentor being Lucas Mallory. Nora had it all, beauty and brains. She finished third in a class of 500 in Stanford, second in Harvard and had clerked for the Chief Justice of California's Supreme Court. Nora Royce was probably the most hated employee through jealousy, that worked at DM&M.;Before the Ballroom doors were opened to announce dinner, the elevator doors opened and out stepped Ruth Mallory. All eyes were on her as they watched her fall, bleeding, trying to crawl to her husband Lucas. It was before him she took her last breath.The cast grows as we meet Amanda Cross, nice to look at, nice to talk to, almost 40, divorced, a lawyer in Century City. She was sharing an office and trying to make it on her own. She had to take the bar twice to pass, had worked in the DA's office and now was trying to eek out a living in her own practice. She cast no great dreams about herself, she felt she was mediocre and wanted to be known as the dependable one. Then the phone call came.Nora Royce had been arrested for the murder of Ruth Mallory. She called the only one she could, when all turned away from her at the good company of Dimsdale. Morris and Mott. She called Amanda Cross, her sister.The relationship between the two women is heartbreaking and just adds `more' to this story. Amanda was 12 years older than Nora. I can relate as a sibling, when my parents had me, times were tougher than when my sister was born. I had homemade stuff, and my sister didn't, and we were only 5 years apart. Well 12 years apart was like being in two different families.Each girl actually was like an only child and never set up any kind of relationship except Amanda being tremendously jealous of Nora and all she got and achieved. There was Nora, feeling left behind by someone she wanted to know but didn't. The saddest thing I think I read was Nora telling Amanda about their parents worrying about her, and Nora's  only wish was that they worried or talked about her when she wasn't home. So sad. This trial will be the challenge of both of their lives.Mark Fleming is introduced through a friend while the three share a table at lunch. He inserts foot in mouth reading a news article about Nora and doing a rant about her. After wearing the newspaper and a pepsi, he comes to Amanda and offers his services to help. He is a jack of all trades, not passing the bar and losing his fianc&eacute; the same day. She decided she did not want a loser and then he gave up trying. He has established himself in many areas doing a multitude of jobs that might be helpful.One other player joins the team, Edward Ramsey. He worked for the firm and comes on board telling them he quit and can be of help. So now you know all the players, the scene is set. We don't care if we solve the murder, all we have to do is cause reasonable doubt.On a shoe string budget, with a ton of hutzpa, Amanda berating herself, her life, and her feeling of helplessness, still pushes forward. She is a bull dog, never taking no for an answer, even when the case is railroaded,  the DA, her old boss, puts the trial on the the fast track with  no delays or continuances allowed.I could not put this book down.

In only 100 or so pages it packed an emotional punch that rivals any book that I have ever read.Matt has been in a tailspin since his partner since childhood left him for a woman. Meaningless sex, non-stop drinking; life is a blur for Matt at the moment. Only the green eyes of a reticent stranger at a bar seen to draw Matt out from his haze of misery. Aaron seems perfect to Matt; intelligent, gorgeous and a beacon of hope. But is Aaron as wonderful as he appears or is he keeping something from Matt as well?Instantly, from the beginning of this book, I connected with Matt. I got right into his head space. I felt so entwined with him. Wow, did Harper Fox do an amazing job. For example, that blowjob scene in the bar... just wow. How did Harper Fox write such beautiful prose that was just exploding with emotion, yet get the gritty, base essence of that scene. I was just so there. I had tears pricking at the corners of my eyes for the whole story. The intensity was present throughout and I could focus on nothing else around me as the story played out. The story as a whole really really worked for me (if you can't tell!!).I could have used more at the end, to be honest. I wanted Matt and Aaron's story to continue.

1212,1212,"I can see why many here enjoyed this book to the tune of four or five stars but for me, it failed on many different levels. If you are like me, it will most likely fail for you too. I'll try to convey my issues without any spoilers, but that restriction makes my task difficult.The setup is that the US has been supplying Turkey with weapons which Turkey has been using to exterminate Kurds. At one point, the book states that thousands of Kurd towns were destroyed with no telling how many Kurds were killed. Unable to stop the Kurds using these tactics, the Turks called for US support. In response, the US invaded and occupied Turkey to the purpose of suppressing the Kurdish objection to being exterminated. As a retaliation for the US supplying arms to the Turks and now for the US soldiers actively assisting in the genocide, some Kurds infiltrate the US to start a campaign of terror to get the US out of the Turkish / Kurdish fight. This is the setup and bluntly, at that point, I was ready to drop this book as perhaps too depressing to continue just due to this scenario. I mean, who is the bad guy at this point?Well, the author makes sure that the Kurds in the US are painted as so evil that you must side against them, but I keep thinking of those thousands of Kurdish villages so casually dismissed in this book on the way to making the Kurds and the leader of the terror campaign evil incarnate. Don't get me wrong. I have no tolerance for terror, but also have none for genocide either. The book offers a choice of nauseating alternatives for the good guys.As to the unfolding of the story (FBI and allies to stop the terror campaign) a good deal of the 'action' is laughable. Here are a few examples I can cite without spoilers. If I were willing to do spoilers, this review would be thousands of words long and a lot funnier.The Kurds are depicted as heartless superbly trained killers yet when they use a captive to lure others into a trap, they untie the captive sufficiently to allow him to signal his rescuers that this is a trap. In another scene, the gimlet eyed Kurdish assassin is charged with stalking and killing a victim. Rather than just shooting the victim, the assassin, in the best James Bond tradition, grabs the proposed victim up, puts her in a car and aimlessly drives around long enough for her to engineer an escape. In another gripping scene, this trained and expert assassin shoots a victim (with a 9 mm pistol) at close range, in the back of the head but she not only lives through it, but doesn't even seem to have much of a headache.In another asinine setup, the FBI needs to question a bunch of good old boys in a country bar to find the location of another country boy who may know the location of the terrorists. A reasonable tactic would be entering the bar and just saying ""We're the FBI looking for the terrorists. Can you tell us the address of So and So?"" That would have worked, but instead, the FBI female dresses up in costume to use sex to winnow the address from one of the bar's patrons. When that doesn't work, the FBI (and FBI ally) end up shooting, beating and terrorizing the patrons until they get the info they seek. Yikes! These guys are rednecks from Arizona. If you asked, they'd take up arms and attack the terrorists themselves. No need to shoot and beat them.One more example. After the terrorism starts in the US, the law enforcement community starts a manhunt, of course, to find the terrorists. They can't find them but when the Maryland mafia decides it wishes to find them, it does so in about 15 minutes with no explanation except an oblique comment about tracking them through their sewage. After the mafia finds the bad guys locale, it fails to inform the FBI for most of the book which gives the bad guys some more time to commit atrocities.I haven't even gotten to the superhuman powers some FBI agents have or the utter stupidity supposedly committed by senior White House staff - all utterly unbelievable.If you just want to rah rah the US and  can dismiss the portrayed genocide of Kurds and can suspend disbelief when superhuman FBI agents get stymied by bozo Kurd terrorists, this one is for you.

She has a party and gives someone the chance to say Happy Birthday and he doesn't. Aaaaaannnnd nothing! Was she disappointed? I thought she would be, but we don't know what she thought. She ushers kids into the super cool-ly decorated room and...spouts a paragraph of simplified solar system info. No responses from the other kids about the speech, none of her thoughts, nothing. (She makes little speeches like this throughout the book and they just hang there.) The kids make paper spaceships (airplanes) which aren't quite finished an hour later when a kid comes late. She asks him if it's okay for everybody to fly them. He says yes. Why is she asking him? Why is he giving permission? What are they thinking?When Mira participates in an event we note that she has an idea or does something, but not how she feels. We're told she's afraid of someone but not why or how it affects her behavior. Traumatic things happen but they are never thought of again. Mira's parents move around and talk like a Stepford family.

1222,1222,"I've read my share of cozy mysteries, so I generally enjoy the genre.  I found this particular one to be unfulfilling, both from the standpoint of the mystery, and in its depiction of the characters.  Also, I would have appreciated it if it had been made clear in the blurb that this is Christian fiction - at least, I thought it so  since anytime the plot was starting to build up any hint of momentum, the two protagonists would stop and quote scripture at each other.  (If the Bible had copyright issues, this book would have lost pages in length.)The female protagonist earned her title of ""limp"" from me because she falls for a man based on the fact that he bears a surface resemblance to her imaginings of Lord Peter Wimsey, and she convinces herself it's a forever thing after a couple of strolls and a kiss.  There are sheltered thirteen-year-olds with more romantic sophistication than this.The male protagonist earns his ""limp"" status because he keeps proposing to the limp heroine, even after multiple rejections, yet doesn't actually do anything to present his case or win her over.  Probably this is intended to show his faithfulness and humility, but this is the kind of nice guy who finishes last in the real world.  And early on in the story, he responds to something the heroine tells him by saying ""Yes, mother.""  Not romantic.  Not sexy.  Not appealing.There are minimal formatting, spelling, or grammatical issues, but for me, in the absence of a genuinely intriguing mystery or engaging characters, this wasn't much of a redeeming feature.

1229,1229,"I finished reading ""The Return: A Novel of Vietnam"" several days ago and in the interim have finished two other shorter books but the characters and the story of this one stay in my mind.I had no problem getting into the narrative within the first couple chapters but then it bogged down for me in the military details of the past -- my problem, not the author's.  That only lasted for a few chapters in which I skimmed through parts that I couldn't or didn't care to understand.  After those parts I couldn't put the book down and resisted the urge to click to the last chapter to see the ending.  I stayed up reading far into the night then most of the next morning to finish the story.The character development and the location descriptions put me right there as the author alternated between the past and the present with the story being told in flashbacks.  At several points I felt myself tearing up over the death of one of the characters that I felt I had come to know.  I was very happy to see some of the characters from the past making it to the present and helping to bring the story to conclusion.

1240,1240,"I love horror novels.  This shouldn't come as a big surprise considering I rave about the brilliantness that is Stephen King every chance I get, but the gore and then general screwed-up-ness is not why I love King's work.  It's his ability to instill fear with very few words. Ironic, I know, since most of his books are about 900 pages long.I was desensitized at a very young age, thanks to cable TV and the fact that my parents sleep like the dead. In the middle of the night when most little girls were dreaming about princes and the ultimate wedding I was sneaking out of my room and watching episodes of ""Tales from the Crypt.""  I loved the rush that the fear afforded me.  Adrenaline is my drug of choice. (You should see the crap I do when I'm bored.)Anyways, the older I got (and the more inappropriate TV that I watched) the more it took for me to hide behind my splayed fingers and pray to God a scene would end quickly.  As a matter of fact...I don't think I've done that in at least 10 years. Why? Because I've moved past the fear of make believe and have dive bombed into the blatant fears of reality that books bring to life.Why is any of this relevant to a psychological thriller that skirts the boundaries of mystical fiction? Because MP McDonald, much like Mr. King was able to manipulate a few well chosen words and send them shooting shock-waves of dread and impending horror through my system.Don't believe me? Ok, I'll share it with you, but first...the synopsis.""Mark Taylor discovers first hand that no good deed goes unpunished when the old camera he found during a freelance job in an Afghanistan bazaar gives him more than great photos. It triggers dreams of disasters. Tragedies that happen exactly as he envisions them. He learns that not only can he see the future, he can change it. Then the unthinkable happened and everyone ignored his frantic warnings. Thousands die. Suddenly, the Feds are pounding on his door and the name they have for Taylor isn't urban hero. It's enemy combatant. And, it means they can do anything they want to him. Anything at all.""Alright, now that I've gotten the business aspect of this review out of the way (stupid synopsis, you stunted my groove!) How about I share with you the words that generated a fist sized lump in my throat.""Mark's apprehension escalated when he noticed some odd features in the room.  Eye rings jutted up from the floor and the cement sloped down towards a rusty drain.  A wood table with six chairs took up the far wall.  Five of the chairs looked like they had been pulled from offices.  One was straight-backed and wooden.  He had no doubt which one was meant for him.""See what I mean? Zero gore.  Zero guts. Only a few words and the promise of something horrifying to come. This passage (which by the way is only one of several passages that convey they same sort of appaling future) only speaks to the amazing writing ability that McDonald possesses.But...rusty drains and eye rings aside, there was another aspect to this story that completely floored me. The magical, disaster predicting camera side of the story.When I first decided to read ""No Good Deed"" I was expecting an A-typical psychological thriller. (Which for the record I have been craving lately) Yes, there was mention of a ""camera that triggers dreams of disasters"" but I had no idea it would turn out to be a camera that actually triggers dreams of disasters! Silly me, I thought it was just a poetic way of being vague. And...if I had known that this story was not only based on the ugly side of governmental reality (I'll let you roll those words around in your head for a minute until you figure out what they mean *cough* Guantanamo Bay-ish *cough*) I have a feeling I wouldn't have been so hung up on the very first sentence of this book. (Which I read approximately 15 different times, on 15 different occasions when attempting to start the novel.)The sentence (just so I can get it out of the way for you)""The baby floated face down in the tub.""See why I had a hard time getting past it?As dissimilar as these two very unique elements were (suspected terrorist vs magical camera) I was genuinely surprised by how well they worked together.  Even better...I was surprised by how utterly enthralled I became in the actions and reactions the two elements provoked in each-other. And for a plot that could have gotten wildly out of hand because of these two varying circumstances, it actually read as a very streamlined well thought out plot, all the way down to it expertly executed characters.Are there pieces of the story where you will have to suspend reality for the sake of fiction? Of course...but that's what good writing does, it makes your imagination run wild.This one might be a tad tough to read in parts, but I think is well worth the money. At the end of the day, it was a great read.Thriller and action junkies welcome.

He is Master.Chef Ariel Valerian is furious when Dane Reese strides into Valerian's Root, the caf&eacute; she and her sister own, as if he wasn't solely responsible for her older sister's sudden defection. It's bad enough that Alayna has taken off for thirty days to stay at a BDSM and D/s school, A Master's Gift, to safely explore her inner submissive. To have one of the co-owners and Masters of that school, Dane, think for a moment he's going to be working at the caf&eacute; to keep the bookkeeping straight while Alayna's away is just too much for Ariel to take.She wants blood. Preferably Dane's. And she wants it now. What she doesn't want is anything to do with Master Dane, his high-handed orders, supercilious attitude, or sexy body. And she works all day with knives. He should beware.The tiny, blue-haired Ariel may have a waspish temper and a sour disposition, but Dane promised Alayna he'd cover her duties at the caf&eacute;, running the business end of the popular eatery. He has every intention of fulfilling that promise. That pugnacious little pixie of a sister of hers is just going to have to deal with it.Dane would love to put Ariel over his knee and teach her a little discipline. Years as a Master has taught him how to spot a submissive a mile away and Ariel is just begging for a firm hand and expert control. Not that she's going to listen to him on the matter. She's too busy fighting him every step of the way.The only way they will ever be able to work together without killing each other is if they put all their cards on the table and make a little wager while setting some strict boundaries. If, by the end of the month, he hasn't opened up the tart little pixie to the joys inherent in filling her deepest needs, he's not the Master he thinks he is. And Ariel isn't the woman he thinks she is. A woman who may change everything for both of them.~*~I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of books that feature certain BDSM elements. I have very wide, thick, practically uncrossable lines relating to that subject. Occasionally, however, I like to read things just outside my comfort zone to push myself a little. I have no intention of jumping on the grey bandwagon, no matter how many shades it is - I prefer well-written fiction that doesn't feature brutalization and sexual sadism packaged as romance, thanks - but I wasn't far into this lovely read by Qwillia Rain before learning that it would be a good choice for wading into uncomfortable waters.First, the focus of this book is far more D/s than BDSM. Though aspects of BDSM are mentioned and Dane is certainly familiar with the more physical aspects of that lifestyle, it's also clear very early into the book that the sexual practices embraced by him as a Dom are healthy, safe, and most importantly, consensual. The clearly defined lines are unequivocal, and at no time is it not completely clear that both parties are able to walk away or end the play at any time without the threat of emotional manipulation or abuse. As it should always be.For me, the best measure of an erotic book is how it would read if the erotic or controversial elements are stripped from it. Rain's writing style is smooth, her narrative polished and sophisticated, and her characters complex and layered. More, Ariel is a spitfire with an unconquerable nature. She's a bit like a terrier, actually, tiny but ferocious as she fights not only everything Dane is about, but her own emotional and physical reaction to him. In that regard, this book tickled my fancy with a top notch enemies-to-lovers theme that complimented the erotic elements of the tale.I liked Dane well enough, but he had a tendency to be infallible in word, action, thought, and deed, and I would have liked to see at least some measure of human failing in him to make him a bit more realistic. The fact that he was a stubborn and immovable rock just wasn't enough to do it. There was just too little compromise in him in all areas in his life. On the flip side, however, it was Dane who was the most emotionally forthright when it came down to the wire, and I had to admire that.The story was seductive and highly sexual, but what impressed me the most was the depth of emotion and strength of character in the romance. Both characters were strong, even in moments of submission, and the feelings they had for each other superseded any sexy games they play. It was a powerful example of how things should be in a healthy relationship of that nature.It was uncomfortable for me at times. I knew it was going to be. I can't say I loved the book for that reason alone. I can say I thought the differences between the BDSM and D/s lifestyles and needs were brilliantly defined, and both were treated with respect and intelligence. Just as the characters and their relationship were. For that alone I commend Rain. For the sexy fun and entertainment value of the read, I applaud her.Disclosure: A copy of this book was provided to me by the author for review.

1247,1247,"Adrianne's books have been on my shelves for over 16 yrs! I enjoy finding new authors, but I always pick up books by my favorites. Adrianne is one of my favorites!  For me, a good book has to have suspense, romance, intrigue and I don't want to be able to guess the murderer or the would be murderer in the first few chapters. That's why I like Adrianne Lee! She delivers every time!Endless Fear had the suspense I crave.  A death years ago, was it murder? Who did it?  Is April in danger? From whom?  No, I'm not going to tell you, no spoilers!

And, of course, may the best 'wo'man win!Initially, I was upset by an upbrupt change to Sam & Griffin's relationship that occurs mid-way through the story.

1273,1273,"After her father's death, Leah Morgan learns his will bequeaths the White Eagle Ranch that she owns and runs to herself and to his two illegitimate half brothers. Brothers she knew nothing about. It's a good thing she's got her Comanche grandfather Ken and veterinarian lover Shane Duffy there to help her get through the turmoil. Shane's been filling her time with hot loving. She's also got Grant Fallon, a geologist who's been surveying the land for minerals. Jealous that Leah hasn't taken him up on his offer to replace Shane and give her more than Shane ever could, he's been telling Leah that perhaps Shane's only there with her for the ranch. Now Leah doubts both men and is uncertain about the outcome of her ranch and her own intimate happily ever after.Not usually into Westerns, I nonetheless chose to read Eagle's Run because it seems that everything talented author Desiree Holt writes is magic.  I'm glad I did. This story has all that I've come to expect from Ms. Holt: a little bit of suspense, emotionally complex characters, and a whole lot of loving. Leah is a wonderfully intelligent, fiercely protective and sensual woman. She doesn't need anyone to save her, she just wants her quiet life on her ranch and her happily ever after with her lover. Shane is fabulously sexy. He's confident and in control... until Leah's in the room. Then he becomes this sexual dynamo. I would have preferred that Leah not already be ensconced in a relationship with Shane but perhaps still getting to know him, but the story was well fleshed, well written and thoroughly enjoyed.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews ([...])",1,1,0.637770898,0.565325078,FL

1286,1286,"A couple of weeks ago, after nearly three and a half years of on and off reading, I finally finished St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica. It is a monumental work, which in printed form extends over five volumes and three thousand densely printed pages. So it is not surprising that it took me this long to finish it. The fact is, though, that I probably would have never ventured into reading it cover to cover in the first place were it not for electronic publishing. The printed version costs $150, which is not actually much considering that most college textbooks these days can cost up to twice that much - if not more. The Kindle edition, on the other hand, costs 99 cents. Yes, it costs less than a dollar. However, it wasn't the price that made me buy it and read it, it was the convenience of electronic form, which made it incredibly portable and accessible. Over the years I would be reading Summa on my Kindle, iPhone, iPad, and in all sorts of common and unlikely places - my desk, my bed, while waiting for my haircut, while waiting for the plane to take off, on the elliptical machine in the gym, while listening to a boring lecture, and sometimes even while waiting for the light to turn green at the traffic stop. (I know, I know.)Summa is not an easy read by any stretch of imagination. It is a densely argued treatise on almost all topics of Christian theology. It is also written in terms of concepts and categories derived form Aristotelian and Medieval philosophy, which are largely unfamiliar to the modern readers. Reading it can oftentimes feel like going through a large advanced mathematics textbook, with all the proofs and carefully precise reasoning that this entails. I knew all of this fully well before taking this plunge, but it did not deter me. I can't say that I carefully thought out all the arguments that were laid out, and probably not much of it stuck with me in the end. However, at the end of it all I believe it was a more than worthwhile endeavor.First of all, it made me renew and deepen my appreciation for the Catholic Theology. It reminded me of the old saw that the Catholic Church is much bigger from within than form without. Catholic Theology is a vast repository of knowledge and insight that is well worth exploring throughout your whole lifetime.Furthermore, anyone who ever reads even a fraction of Summa could not in good faith ever resort to using the term ""medieval"" in a derogatory and pejorative sense. The erudition, the intellectual firepower, and the appreciation of human knowledge in all of its forms and all of its extent is clearly at display in this monumental work. St. Thomas spent most of his professional life at the University of Paris, and the university system that we have to this day has been formed throughout the Catholic Europe around this time. This system fostered and sustained scholarship and research in all branches of human knowledge. All of us, whatever our field of expertise, owe a huge debt of gratitude to these efforts. Modern world without this strong foundation would never have gotten into the existence. At the heart of this system, and at the etymological root of the very term University, is the ideal of universality of all knowledge. This idea shines brightly in Summa. Unfortunately in recent times we have diverged from this ideal. Perhaps going back to Summa would be exactly the medicine for what ails the modern University.Finally, for me reading any type of good theological work is never just an intellectual exercise. It is, foremost in fact, a form of devotion. I've read Summa oftentimes early in the morning at the start of a new day. I've read it in conjunction with, or sometimes instead of, my scripture readings. Theology for me is the place where I can fully and completely love my God with all my heart, all my soul, and all my mind. I am grateful to St. Thomas for leaving us this great book that can help us in our Christian vocation. More than that could not be asked from anyone.St. Thomas Aquinas, pray for us.",1,1,0.591531756,0.480131326,AZ

He provides the strongest arguments for his opponent's positions and after arguing to the contrary, he shows the flaws in his opponent's positions.

1290,1290,"I didn't enjoy this one. If I can be honest, I don't enjoy the writing style as much as book 1. I like the narrator's voice, but considering this book was written in a four person POV, the narrator didn't even bother trying to differentiate the voices. I ended up rewinding a few times to see who was talking since it featured Zach & Angelo and Matt & Jared. My enjoyment of this series really plummeted with this book.This book started with Zach giving Angelo a free pass to be with another man, with the agreement that Angelo come home to him afterwards. Considering how hard they fought to be together 4 months ago, I was surprised that Angelo would quickly jump at the opportunities.The main problem that I had was that Angelo throws a conniption fit if someone looks sideways at Zach. It just seems hypocritical, and I was unsure of Zach's true motivations for allowing the free pass. If I really got why, I might have been able to accept it more.I completely with Jonathan's assessment that it would appear that they had an open relationship, but it only works one way. I mean, Angelo is getting a handjob on a public dancefloor in front of Zach, but Angelo attacks Jonathan for kissing Zach. Can you say hypocrite?I don't think Jonathan owed Angelo an apology, maybe an explanation but Angelo didn't even have the decency to offer  Jonathan an apology and explanation back. Angelo was just a taker and Zach a doormat in this book, and I didn't like it at all.Jared and Matt have been together for a little over a year, but Matt talked about how going all the way felt wrong. I am confused. In the prior books it seemed like they couldn't get enough, but Matt explains they do &#34;other stuff&#34;. I want to know if Matt is really gay because his feeling of guilt or that it doesn't &#34;feel right&#34; should concern Jared.I just don't get these relationships. I know everyone has what works for them, but right now, neither couple's interactions are working for me.  I will try one more book in this series before I give it up.",1,0,0.637209302,0.27209302399999996,AZ
1291,1291,"First and foremost, I'd just like to point out that this is actually a good book but ultimately the open-relationship Zach allowed Angelo to have killed my enjoyment of the story. I'm not saying I judge their relationship, I just don't understand it and I don't want to read about it. If you like reading about all that and if you don't mind open-relationships, that's cool, but I prefer monogamous relationships over anything else and that's that. :-/It was great getting another installment of the guys, though. In the past, Angelo was my favorite character but, unfortunately, he's not anymore. He's actually my least favorite now and Matt is firmly at the top. Anyways, I liked the fact that we got to see Matt get a little more intimate with Jared in public (there's only a brief scene but still, it was sweet) and I liked the fact that Zach and Angelo get closer through their little 'kink'. It was nice how everything worked out in the end even if it wasn't the way I'd like it to have ended.I will say that I thought Angelo was a freaking hypocrite the way Zach let him fool around with other guys but he wouldn't let Zach do the same. And I also thought it was way out of character for Angelo to do that since in A to Z he was pretty gaga over Zach and didn't give any indication that he'd do something like that but that's just my opinion. At the beginning, I thought Angelo was walking all over Zach but it's clear by the end that Zach actually gets turned on by Angelo dancing with other guys and knowing that by the end of the day, Angelo will always be his. Still don't understand it but all power to them, right?I liked seeing pieces of Angelo's old personality and how he could pretty much lose anyone with how he just goes off topic and then back on it again. There was also brief spurts of humor I rather enjoyed and I especially enjoyed getting back into Matt's head again.All in all, I think this would have been a great book if the whole conflict of Zach and Angelo's sexual life would have been left out but that's just my opinion and because of that, I can't recommend this book.

1292,1292,"... Well maybe not let down as much as disillusioned. I have read about open relationships in other books and have not had a big problem with it...not really my flavour but if it is set up right then it's fine. I think what threw me is it the book opens with Angelo and Cole having sex with Zach going, sure whatever you want. Now, I had just read their book, Angelo and Zach's and there was nothing in that book that sets up the relationship as moving in that direction... If anything it is the opposite. So, overall while I think the book was technically well done I am just feeling disappointed in their relationship now. I think that if the author had prepared the way in the first book it wound not have been so bad ,,but that didn't happen. so this whole open relationship, one sided by the way (Angelo only), just ended them in a sour note for me.",1,0,0.540540541,0.247401247,AZ

Her begging the little girl that had cared and loved her until the little girl's father heartlessly began experimental testing on it. The rabbits little voice and begging broke my heart. Several other times when I the animals in this story found their voice I wiped falling tears from my eyes. That alone I felt this story deserved a high rating.I however, found the human characters two dimensional and and awkward in their communicating with each other. There is very little detail about their thoughts and feelings. But I began to see that there was very detailed feelings and descriptions in the animals and their surroundings, so I got the feeling that the author wanted the story's primary focus on the animals and their plight not the human characters.Overall a touching and thoughtful book that makes you see animals in a different light.",1,1,0.595121951,0.49390243899999997,AZ

I have to feel very strongly about an unfinished book to post an opinion about it.It was a very interesting premise, which is what prompted me to pick it up. I'm an animal person myself, have always wished I could communicate with animals and the plot sounded interesting.I got a third of the way through the book. Very little plot apparent even at that point, unfortunately. However, what absolutely turned me off this book was the rampant pro-PETA/HSUS agenda that was, as far as I could tell from reading as far as I did, the main objective of the author and the reason for the book. Not the story, anyway.The rescue of the sled dogs abandoned by dog sled racing people was bad. The description of lab animals when the main character was a child and her step father arbitrarily took her pet rabbit to be a lab test animal even worse. But what really capped it for me is when there was a long description of the 'memory' of the life of a commercially-raised chicken triggered by the main character taking a bite of cooked chicken. That was the last straw for me.I realize everyone has their own ideas about things but 'message' is one thing and trying to stuff something down by throat, calling it entertainment is something else entirely.Members of PETA or HSUS may get by these things without a problem. There may be a plot in the last 2/3 of the book that I didn't get to. However, like the main character being unable to swallow the bite of chicken, I couldn't stomach reading any more of the book.",1,0,0.587537092,0.0,AZ

Yay!That being said, it's not the best I've read but it was decent for sure.  There were a few parts that had me laughing out loud, a few lines of dialogue that were really witty and the characters were developed well, too.

I'm sad to say that it fell short of my expectations. It wasn't the most original book I've ever read, it didn't have a very exciting plot, the characters were shallow and static, and the overall theme was un-impressive. I expected this story to be as witty and interesting as Flat-Out Love, but it wasn't even in the same ball-park, which was extremely disappointing. I think three stars is fair for this book; it is well-written and an enjoyable story, but there's nothing spectacular about it and the plot was virtually non-existant.

No doubt I'll be slated for my opinion given how many think otherwise. But here goes. It starts out ok - the only early gripe was the writing style which is a bit lacking, simplistic. It is hard to describe without using the words pulp fiction. Which has come to mean something else. I see this style as belonging on supermarket shelves - mass fiction which needs no thought. And then the story. It is a good premise, the kind of is he isn't he . Childhood memories that are missing and therefore our killer could be our author. Even he does not know. I worked it out half way through. I lost patience then with our hero's stupidity and interest along with it. I skimmed to the end although tempted to abandon ship but I was promised a twist after all. Ha, should have known better! One word can sum this up - predictable. It has been years since I read Stephen King to whom this author is compared in some of these rave reviews. From what I remember of Mr. King I see no resemblence. Stephen King is a master of suspense.

Silkin's description of the ""cemetery vote"" being bused to the polls is a variation of the practice that I grew up in.Silkin does an excellent job of weaving his characters into his story. At first you may wonder what do all of these diverse people and situations have to do with each other, but as you read he brings all of them together and makes you realize that in real life how disparate people and events are tied together. So that a computer hacker can become the leader of new political movement.

He is difficult to like with his extra curricular marital activities.  One hopes he can solve his crime - but it is hard to feel sorry for him or root for him due to his lack of likability.There were loose ends (likely due to length)  and some rushed and unfinished plot devices.  The malaise of the wife, the popping in and out of the small town bombshell waitress, the sister from his past (just teasers about her story line tossed in), the started issues with the Black (cannot remember names - Clay and Timmy?) family.  The guilty party just pops in for minor appearance, then is never heard about (save one small descriptive bit about history)  until in his residence to catch him for he now being main suspect.

There is a clear vision here and Shannon wastes few words. One of the things I most enjoyed about the story was the way the novella started with a burst of action, with Kenzie having to make a life and death decision right at the start.In the long run, that decision leads to an early retirement and we find Kenzie heading from L.A. to become Sheriff in the town where he grew up.  Twin Forks is out there in the Nevada desert and there's a bit of strangeness as he gets lost along the way and meets an old man on the BRIMSTONE TURNPIKE.  Just when it seems Kenzie is settling into a routine in Twin Forks the case that lead to his ""retirement"" shows up in the quiet Nevada town.  Leading to an ending that's precisely what one might expect from the mind of Harry Shannon.Overall a top notch thriller/horror story with an ending I dare you to see coming.

Basically the issue many will have with this story is that it starts out as what appears to be a well-written thriller with only a hint of occult horror - something like the film ""Seven"" for example - then switches rather abruptly to an almost pure occult horror. A bit trying on the whole ""suspension of disbelief"" thing.In some ways the conventional side of me wishes Shannon would have picked either a thriller or an occult horror direction for this book, not both. It would have been more satisfying for most readers like me, I suppose. On the other hand, it was kind of interesting to find the lines blurred a bit. Would give this a 3.5 if it was possible but rounded up for the risks Shannon consciously took with this story. Some may accuse him of poor plot development but he is far too talented a writer to have botched it as far as I'm concerned.

1327,1327,"Harry Shannon's Behold the Child is a story wrapped in enough intrigue to keep the reader guessing and balances that out with enough action to keep the plot moving forward at a tight pace. Originally part of a Cemetery Dance anthology, it follows the story of troubled Detective Sam Kenzie as he obsessively pursues a serial killer of children.This novella is an example of brevity at its best. Though short in lenght, it packs in a complex plot with dynamic shifts in setting and a lead character that is worthy of any full length novel. The author spent much of his early career working in Hollywood and it's evident in Behold the Child (as well as his other novels) that film has a huge influence on his work. There's no padding. This is a lean story driven by action, dialogue, and visuals. Despite taking place over an extended period of time, it never drags or dawdles.The lead character is at times infuriating, admirable, heroic, and damaged; he's simultaneously someone to root for and someone you want to fix. The author gives us just enough pain in the backstory for the character's damage to be real, but not too much so as it's overwhelming. His journey throughout the novella is one that we have to take with him because we believe in him.Another major highlight was the ending. Without giving anything away for those who haven't read it yet, the ending is one of those icing-on-the-cake endings that most writers worth their salt should strive for. The icing here is sure to be a sweet treat for horror fans. It's VERY satisfying and ties the story up perfectly.If you haven't read it yet, go ahead and download it for Kindle.

I think 17 pages is pretty generous for a short story, in my opinion.  If you haven't read the Jeff Resnick series, you might want to read one just to get the flavor of the series. Jeff Resnick is almost psychic. He doesn't like to call himself that. But, he does feel things, and get premonitions. This short story has both a premonition and another look at his life. It's kind of like a little read between the books. It's like bonus material for 99 cents - not a bad price for a short story by a great author. ""Bah!

It's so delightful and witty - from the very first page of the book. This book made me chuckle and laugh so many times. One of the things I like about Lanyon's books is actually the fact that the story begins right away from the first page in full gear.The mystery part of Fair Game was very clever: there were so many possible suspects. I changed my mind about the murderer at least half a dozen times as the story proceeded! I also like the way some of Lanyon's books have titles with multiple meanings - just like Fair Game did.The chemistry between Elliot and Tucker was titillating and intense. I absolutely love how Lanyon's characters feel so real and imperfect in their actions. These guys weren't neither perfect nor one-dimensional for sure! I genuinely enjoyed the way they argued and the way their logic and squabble twisted and turned and held so many emotions in both sides. All the awkward moments between the main couple were so tangible it almost hurt! These guys fit together so badly that it was impossibly hot, annoying and totally enjoyable. It also was very interesting how in the beginning of the book it looked like that it was Elliot who had been dumped, but when the story continues we find out that both men had been pretty lost at the time of their separation. And the scapegoat Tucker proves to be a very emotional and endearing sweetheart.I did love the sex scenes in this book. The actual sex happens long after a fabulous kiss-in-the-car-scene and an ultra-passionate scene by/in the lake after Elliot gets shot. Those scenes, the extreme tension between the main couple and Elliot's memories about him and Tucker together worked like a sweet, long foreplay.",1,1,0.621082621,0.778964862,GA

If you don't mind uncomfortable settings (war) and circumstances (widowhood, capture & pursuit by the enemy) and relationships that seem destined to go nowhere (regrettable class barriers), then you might enjoy this. It started off nicely, but got steadily gloomier. At about 70%, I gave it up altogether - while it might have had a satisfying ending, by that point I was too discouraged to care.Other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Carla Kelly, but I was disappointed to find the wartime setting was the only thing the novels shared. I absolutely loved Carla Kelly's Marrying the Captain, Royal Marine and Surgeon series. They were gritty portrayals of war as secondary to the romance - yet the romances were heart-warming, uplifting and somehow full of hope. I don't mind angst and tension, but I must feel hopeful. I read for pleasure and this book just struck me as too gloomy. The hero and heroine seemed too willing to accept that they had no future together. Their relationship always focused on imminent separation, so they didn't fully enjoy the present.Just wasn't the book for me, I'm sorry to say. I'm sorry because I would have loved to have found another author who can offer such heartwarming stories as Kelly.

1342,1342,"4.5****'StarsWhen we receive book submissions from Alexandr Voinov, I look at page one as a reading adventure. I never know what to expect, but I do know I will love the rush. This seems to be a pre-quel to something more, and he has paired this journey with author Kate Cotonor. My rating might not be justified. It is a 4.5****Stars because it does leave the reader wanting, even though there is a beginning a middle and a happy-for-now ending. So, you be the judge if I was harsh in my rating.William Raven is a squire in the English Manor of Lord Robert de Cantilou. A squire is an underling in training to Knighthood. This is William's dream. Our story begins as Sir Robert returns from a five year crusade in the Holy Lands. Five years have passed since Sir Robert's wife died, and rather than take a new bride for his children, he left with five senior knights to see the world, leaving the child raising to Lady Alais and nannys.Upon his arrival, Lord Robert called a meeting of his squires and knights, telling them that they soon would have guests, and a hunt  that would be held by order of the king. They would entertain French nobility from the County of Toulouse. William's mind went racing. If he performed well he might ""gain his spurs"" to become a knight at last. If he were noticed by the nobles he could win riches and fame.Politics and rumors abound, young Henry was at odds with his father, The King, and the emissaries from Toulouse were at Westminster. The French and the English had border issues. Along with the French, Sir Robert announced one of the guests would be his brother Stephen. Everyone knew there was no love lost between the two. So the scene is set, yes? The staff, the squires, the knights all working hard in preparation for their guests. William is working so hard to perform and be seen by Sir Robert.It is the night before their guests arrive. William, having drunk too much ale, is lying in his bunk listening to another squire who has taken a serving girl to bed. Someone settles behind him, reaching for him. The body behind him is not feminine, and that excites him even more. In the dark he knows not who it is and when he awakens the following morning feels it might have been a dream.After recently reading Scorpion, and its secretive male/male  sexual  encounters which might turn some readers off,  this wonderful relationship is wonderfully open, sexy and sensual. The wooing of William Raven is a great part of the story, but the storyline takes us into intrigue, murder and a cast of good and evil. Brother Stephen in particular is a man you love to hate. With shocking revelations and steamy male sensuality, this book delivers. Kate Cotonor is new to me, but not for long.

I look for engaging characters, natural dialog, well-paced and intriguing plot, enough background and setting but not too much boring detail.""The Prophet Motive"" fulfilled all those criteria quite well, better than average.  It had the ring of authenticity when it concerned cults and cult leaders; no so much for other factors, such as the way police and FBI make decisions.Dialog and description were clunky at times and I remember one vignette that stopped me in my tracks.  Bad Guy mounted on horseback.  Good Guy (I'm trying hard not to make it a spoiler here) on foot.  Bad Guy intends to capture or injure Good Guy.  Good Guy walks up to the horse, uncinches the saddle so that Bad Guy falls off, vaults onto horse and rides off bareback.  Oh, really?  Pleeze...and no earlier discussion of Good Guy had given any hint of that person's equestrian experience.  Hmmm....Inspector's reinstatement was miraculously fast, practically overnight.

1349,1349,"After serious contemplation, my opinion is that sensitive readers may want to take a pass on this uneven and, in places, somewhat unpleasant book.Part of the problem is the subject matter, part is the uneven writing, and part is the character of Homicide Inspector John Richetti, a highly-stressed hard-drinking policeman who was caught up in the Jonestown cult as a child in the `70s -- the one where 900 people drank the Kool-Aid.At times, Richetti is so dimwitted and irresponsible that even his undercover partner calls him a ""stupid bastard."" Here's one example: He gives seven sleeping pills -- seven! -- to a cult member not used to taking them (this isn't a bad guy) and the person almost doesn't wake up. Here's another: Despite being specifically warned not to tell the truth because admitting personal weaknesses lets the cult get their hooks into you, he openly admits his involvement at Jamestown. He always knows best and he's always wrong.In fact, neither of the investigators, Richetti or Marilyn Michaelsen, the police department psychologist who accompanies him under cover, is up to the task -- the supremely dangerous job of infiltrating the Earthbound cult and bringing two suspected murderers to justice. But at least Michaelsen has some brains and self control. Richetti is a fool.But here's the crux of it.If you're touchy about abusive situations involving children or violent rape or coercive acts involving feces (I'm sorry, there's just no oblique way to say it), you should really consider giving this book a wide berth. At the part about forced coprophagia about two-thirds of the way in -- hey, you're going to have to look it up, I'm not defining it -- I almost put the book down in disgust.

1351,1351,"I'm very glad I read the book and I'm giving it four stars because I cannot rate it at three-and-a-half. Flossie and her family lived a very difficult life, some of which was of their own making.  Her story is quite compelling and it was was an eye-opening read for me. I had no idea such performers existed so long into the twentieth century*.  I had certainly never heard of the Turner Family previously and for that reason alone, I'm glad I happened upon her story. She seems to write about even her own character flaws with honesty, for which she is to be commended.But I don't want to critique their lives, only Flossie's writing; she had a co-author so I would have expected a little higher caliber in that department.And the writing is why I drop it from the four stars I would like to rate it. The writing was at times a bit confusing, such as the events and time line around her mother's death. I thought she died at the young age of forty-three, but then Flossie states she was in her sixties. And sometimes the tense would change in mid-paragraph, so I had to re-read a passage to see if I had mis-read it the first time. I guess better editing would have helped.And then Flossie's attitude at times confused me. She knew what each member of her family was like, how they used everybody they could, but she continually put herself in situations where they would use her, and then she complained about being used by those very people. Her heart seems to have been in the right place, but I found the ""why me"" tone of the book annoying.All-in-all, it's worth reading, even just to educate oneself about an interesting time in history.

1353,1353,"Heppner has done it again!  He has produced an amazingly compelling story that sucks you in from the first word and doesn't let you go until you look up in surprise when the book's all over.  This book, just like the first in the series (Giants), is a thumping good read of the first order.  Heppner's storytelling's is split pretty equally between Joash, our young adult narrator of the first book and his companions who become separated from each other due to a shipwreck by a sea monster.The goal of the book is to determine the reason that the First Born, the Giants, the Gibbers and the Nephilim wanted the adamantine armor, sword and shield.  Through many adventures,loss of life and heroics the Elonites have determined the reasons for gaining the adamantine weapons.  The reasons are so perilous that one could bring hell on Earth and the other could wipe everything off the face of the planet.  There is no choice - they must be stopped.When sailing back home they are attacked by a sea monster who was in league with a First Born in on the Plan.  Joash is with Heret and Joash's dog Harn.  Lord Uriah, his sister Lillith the Great Prioress, Aurochs the former pirate, Amery, Uriah's Granddaughter and Adah the Singer from Posidonis all ended up in a lifeboat dodging pirates.  Each group thinks the other is dead so that it falls to them to tell the world of the looming disaster that awaits mankind if the evil one's succeed.  One group will be successful, the other will get caught by the enemy.  The ending again wraps up neither too short nor too rushed.  No cliffhangers, just nicely wrapped up storylines leaving you in little doubt where the next book is heading.  Again, even though I would like to give an extra star for this, I can't possibly because I'm already all maxed out.Again, the characterization was absolutely genuine and three dimensional.  New characters like Aurochs and Idra are fully 3D.  There are no moments when you scratch your head and say WTF as the characters act out of context or just to further the story.  You care about all the good characters, even some of the evil ones are interesting such as Mimir the Wise and the Father of all Giants, Jotun.  The pacing in this book is identical to last - gripping your brain and not letting up for a nanosecond with times of increased dramatic tension.  It is really masterful.  The growth of the characters, or not, is a direct result of their faith, background and suffering.  Joash continues to meet his challenges head on, no matter what those around him are doing.  His girlfriend, on the other hand, was so severely damaged in her earlier life that she finds it easier to succumb to horror and depression.  Herret is a warrior who has rarely lost.  When he's knocked on his bottom like child by a First Born, all he can think of is vengeance.  When the immaturity of this is pointed out to him he indulges in a bit of reality postponement.  All of these are credible behaviors for the characters that Heppner's written.All in all, I would highly recommend the first two books in this Lost Civilizations series to anyone who likes any type of fantasy or mythology, or is just interested in one man's unique take on a phase of the world's creation and growth.

1358,1358,"4.5 StarsJohn Bowers has written an impressively constructed, gritty sci-fi that blends several genres: military novel, political allegory, and Bildungsroman. His writing is sharp and clear, with natural-sounding dialogue and snappy, economical phrasing. His prose is error-free.The book's main character, Oliver Lincoln III, is a young man who identifies as pacifist, even though his father runs a major arms company known for its excellent space fighters. To Oliver's way of thinking, such craft should only be used for planetary defense. The novel's main plot takes Oliver from his native Terra (which seems to be the future Earth) to one of the many planets humans have colonized, Sirius. He's there to sell his company's fighters to the Sirian military. While there, Oliver comes to suspect that the Sirians have designs on another human-colonized planet, Vega. As the plot progresses, Oliver moves away from his pacifist impulses.He moves about as far as you can get, actually. The strongest parts of the novel, I thought, were those that follow Oliver on the battlefield. Bowers does a terrific job portraying warfare's disturbing mixture of camaraderie, horror, frustration, terror, and excitement. It's through this meaty central portion of the novel that Bowers generates a convincing coming-of-age story as we follow Oliver from where he starts -- as a nice and bright but naive and pudgy young man -- to where he ends up --  as a fit, tough, morally righteous, yet very humane warrior.Meanwhile, the novel's subplot follows events back on Terra, where Oliver's family worries about his fate and where his best friend, Henry Wells, pursues a related political agenda.I'd categorize The Fighter King as ""soft sci-fi."" Though Bowers gives us a world with FTL travel, laser weapons, and anti-grav devices on vehicles and elevators, the emphasis isn't on the tech. It's on warfare and politics. Battlefield strategy relies on trench lines, infantry ground assaults, and field artillery, giving those scenes a WWII, rather than futuristic, feel. The novel's gender politics also remind me more of mid-20th-century sci-fi: almost every woman Oliver encounters is a sweet, guileless, gorgeous babe, and he's irresistible to them -- even near the beginning of the novel, when he's not just short and balding, but also pudgy. I thought this element of the novel was rather charming -- sort of Captain Kirk-y -- though I can imagine some readers finding it tad annoying that the female characters don't have a bit more heft. I believe other books in the larger Fighter Queen Saga have more central female characters.The novel's political subplot, especially the heavy use of allegory therein, did strike me as a bit weaker than the main plot. Bowers inventively aligns the Sirians with the mid-19th-century U.S. Confederacy. He does this both allegorically -- his main character is named Lincoln, etc. -- and by proposing a literal connection: Sirius was colonized in part by rascist groups from the American South (Bowers gives the Sirians southern accents), which then took over the planet, subjugating and enslaving other colonizing groups. This racist civilization is aggressively imperial (there's also a Nazi connection, as the Sirian president is named Adolph). Their militarism is motivated by their desire to acquire new ""product"" for their slave trade. They seem to be primarily interested in enslaving women, and the peaceful planet of Vega is known for its genetically engineered beauties.In Bowers's hands, this set-up yields a passionately political novel: pro-human rights, anti-racist, and pro-military. That message comes through convincingly in Oliver's experiences, and I liked it. But the Henry Wells subplot makes strong allegorical connections to the contemporary U.S., and that allegorical turn made the latter parts of the novel strike me as a bit heavy-handed. Fortunately, the subplot is a relatively small part of the overall book, and the main plot is very strong.I notice The Fighter King has been given a new cover, which I think improves on the silhouette-style art the book had when I downloaded it. The book's formatting is good, but there are scattered small glitches. They certainly don't impeded understanding; they're cosmetic.This is an edited version the review posted on my blog.

The Fighter King is a rock-solid launch to the seriesof stories by John Bowers featuring the arc of an interstellar war.  It haseverything that you would want in a military SF novel.  Explosions.Strategy. Panic. Tactics. Arms dealers. Political maneuvers.  Soldiers cussing.Hi technology.  Death, destruction, and bloody mayhem.  But the violence andgore here is not gratuitous, and the sweep of the novel leaves it a cut abovethe usual military SF fare.  Certainly, we see the typical situation wherewar brings out the best and worst in our species.  But with majestic andimpressive world-building, Bowers weaves a yarn that portrays dynastictensions, lessons about humanity, and a careful study of the yin-and-yangof aggression and deterrence vs. the pacifistic instinct.  Bowers certainlyknows how a story is put together, and he is particularly talented when itcomes to using conflict to its best advantage.  The characters are archetypesat some level, but they evoke sympathy at surprising moments.  Readers shouldbe under no illusions about the unblinking view of extremely violent brutalityand graphic portrayal of inhumanity here - definitely, this is not a talefor the squeamish or faint of heart, or those who prefer less violence.  I'mnormally in the latter group myself.  However, some of the best SF messageshave come from such tales, and this is, after all, a memorable story with amessage.

One night, in a fit of sexual tension, she pleasures herself in her home office, secretly intrigued by the thought of being an exhibitionist as she stares out her open windows. After all, even though the next door neighbor's lights are off, his windows are open as well.Skyler Brody can't believe his good luck. The homicide cop on the mend from a gunshot wound enjoys watching his beautiful neighbor through his open, darkened windows. They may not have met before now but he'll make sure to rectify that situation pronto and turn all her fantasies into hot, sexy reality.Scorched is one hot, quick read. Sexy-as-sin detective Sky is a hero that comes across as refined, but dominant. Someone who knows what he wants and goes after it full tilt. I understand his desire to keep his profession a secret, but the amount of angst and turmoil that went through him before finally confessing teetered the edge for me. I really didn't think one bad breakup constituted the difficulties he had.Sexually deprived Kasey made me laugh. Often. She lived vicariously through her book characters to the point that she almost couldn't believe her luck when Sky showed up at her door. The chemistry was pretty hot between this duo, but it seemed unrealistic that Kasey would welcome in a stranger she hardly knew, simply because he showed her his ID. Then they quickly move to sex as if his ID somehow gave permission for her to fall into bed with him, simply because she was horny.It was a decent story, but it could have been expanded a little bit, giving these characters some more in depth background and a chance for Sky and Kasey to get to know one another.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews.",1,1,0.609550562,0.297191012,GA

She gives out her safe word, quite liberally, and knows she wants more. She's a woman with split desires, wanting to serve another, but also simply wanting hotter sex. Which desire will overcome the other?Sir Ethan Kendall is a Master through and through. Having left the BDSM scene, he's now pretty reclusive. So when this determined woman breaks through his security, begging to be trained, he finally relents, inviting her to come to his home for a short stay. He warns her that should she cross his threshold, she should be prepared to completely submit. He's not a play partner, he's a Dom, and will give her nothing less.When she arrives, she's greeted by not only Ethan, but also by his servant Thomas. Her perceptions of BDSM are shaken, her life turned upside down, and she suddenly realizes her submission is anything but a game.Sierra Cartwright amazes me again. As soon as I read Ethan and Alana's conversation and his stern words that he's not a play Dom, someone she can safe word around simply because she doesn't want to do something, I understood his mindset. It's the reason why many Doms and subs don't prefer the dungeon scene. It's not a game for them. It's life and they won't accept anything less.Alana really believes she wants to submit to this man. Unable to see all the thoughts of her mind, one can attempt to guess that while she has enjoyed the kink from past experiences, she's still very much in control, so it doesn't fully satisfy. Ethan wants her full submission and won't train her unless she's willing to offer it. He won't have her tell him what she does or doesn't want to do, and on the other hand, won't have her keeping secrets or fears from him.Ethan's a strict Master, intuitively knowing which of her boundaries to push, and when. He brings her to places she had never even conceived. And then she comes to the realization that her two-week stay will soon be over. How in the world can she return to the reality she left behind? It's like tasting the finest wine, then being told that they have to return to their diet of grape juice. Of course, I won't reveal the ending, that's something for the reader to explore for herself.

Ethan hs stopped training subs some time ago already, but is intrigued by Alana who seems a lot of fun to break and master.So he accepts her to become his trainee, he accepts her to his house in England and his friend, employee and sometimes sub Thomas is also very interested in her.Giving up all her free will, becoming a slave to Ethan and Thomas's desires is so far rom what she expected that she has real troubles accepting, bending to Ethan's will but her need to please him /them overrules her fears.The story is very erotic, very hot but really focused on pain and submission.

Johnny Lincoln strives to be the greatest fighter pilot ever while he also struggles with a perplexing relationship with his father and certain aspects about his own birth his parents refuse to explain.  These two primary characters are thrust into war where they work together and fall deeply in love.A Vow to Sophia gives open insight to the lives of combat soldiers, the close quarters they must live in as well as the relationships they must share with fellow soldiers...some of whom they don't necessarily like or want to be around.  We see the raw emotions these soldiers are sure to feel not just during battle but during down time.  The different personalities that clash but because of their situation must learn to put their differences aside; the confrontations that bring those differences to the forefront and the consequences they pay.  We also see the strong loyalty of combat personal who care deeply for one another, strive to protect one another and grieve when one of them is lost.This is an intriguing story.

1407,1407,"First Kill All The Lawyers by Patricia Clark has great start but fizzles at the end. What drew me to this book was the premise of a serial killer targeting lawyers. What a promising premise, unfortunately Clark doesn't deliver on the promise.The beginning of the story is strong as Clark pairs up a grizzled street cop and a FBI profiler. They are exact opposites so the reader is set-up for the personality conflicts that will undoubtedly arise as the duo pursues the serial killer but these conflicts never happen because Clark regulates the street cop to the background of the story soon after the beginning. The whole story takes a nose dive at this point.As the story continues the reader has to constantly battle to suspend disbelief. For example, a brother and sister who both happen to be FBI agents stationed in the Washington D.C. area. A stretch at best but I'm willing to make it to stay in the story. However, Clark includes a famous country singer for a love interest who happens to have an uncle who is ex-CIA, who will conveniently provide all the clandestine help necessary to solve the case. This pushed suspension of disbelief to the utmost limits.The corny characters were bearable but what wasn't bearable was the ending. Clark builds the story and prepares the reader for a great climatic battle between the serial killer and the protagonist only there is no battle, just revelation of the identity of the killer.First Kill All The Lawyers had the makings of a great yarn then it just fizzled.

Despite this interesting set-up, the author delivers an annoying and unbelievable story. Let me clarify my objections: (a) neither of the two lead characters are likeable; (b) the before-mentioned hot-headed cadet main character hasn't served any time aboard space craft but is given command of the Phoenix one day before it sets out on the historic voyage; (c) stretching my credibility even further is the cadet is an unmotivated genius who distrusts anyone in authority and this is offered up as reason he is given command; (d) the main character abruptly switches between self-adulation-boorish-nuts-to-you-all attitude to an awkward depressed-I'm-no-good-to-anyone like a flash-bulb going off; and, finally, (e) the alien space ship screen is surprisingly easy to breach.This would be a one star review but for one reason - the book is cheap so one can't complain too loudly for what you get.",1,0,0.631229236,-0.046096345999999996,MA

1417,1417,"During a trade show with a co-worker from another division, Julia Landon blows Trevor Kendall's mind when she says that she's incredibly bored, and to combat this &uuml;ber boredom, he should spank her. Trevor never saw the signs that Julia had submissive tendencies but he's more than eager to teach her the finer elements of Domination and submission.For the rest of the evening, he teaches her that D/s isn't all about her own selfish pleasures but those of her Dominant, which should in turn offer her pleasure in return. The only problem is the trade show is ending in a couple of days. Perhaps they'll see each other in six months, perhaps a year.  But once the night is over, how will she be able to return to her bored-out-of-her-mind existence?It was thoroughly enjoyable to read Julia's exploration into the world of BDSM.  Previously understanding that D/s is nothing more than a playful slap and tickle before an evening of mind-blowing sex, Julia's finally beginning to understand that the dynamic of D/s is much more profound, and doesn't always follow the protocol that she wishes. Instead she must rely on and trust the Dom to guide her and to bring them both fulfillment.Julia's feistiness was hilarious at times, and contrasted to the intensity and sometimes severity of Trevor, but rather than detract from the story it added to it. In fact, while Trevor is an uncompromising Dom, his complete attention is on her at all times, and when he begins to have feelings for her, it softens his edges, but only by a smidge, for which readers will be grateful. I doubt many would be pleased if he'd melted into a complete sap upon realization that he's found the submissive of his dreams.There's no doubt about it. S&M; 101 is a slightly darker view of the journey into BDSM. It's not merely kinky play in a club. It's a fiercely intense dynamic developing between two people. In a very short period of time, Trevor pushes Julia's boundaries, confident that he can bring her to places she's never even considered. And while some stories have that same degree of edginess, with this couple it all seems so real, almost as if the reader is peeking in on a factual diary entry. Truth be told, at 42 pages, one might consider it a mere diary entry, but since it's packed with such action and emotion it felt like a much longer story. Author Sierra Cartwright is known for delivering some great BDSM stories, but she's clearly outdone herself with this one.

1420,1420,"This first paragraph is going to be embarrassing for me.  You see, I've known of David B. Silva as a writer for twenty years; yet, I'm ashamed to say, I'd never read anything by him.  Why?  Hell if I know.  I have dozens and dozens of books by other authors who I haven't read as of yet.  I buy books I intend to read and then never get around to them because I have so many to catch up on.  One day, before I kick the bucket, I hope to read everything I own.Okay, what made me decide to finally read All the Lonely People?  That's an easy question to answer.  I tried starting a new novel last weekend by an author I'd never read before and couldn't get more than five pages into the book.  I hate that, especially when books cost so much money.  It's like throwing dollars bills into the wind.  I wanted to like the novel, but there were simply too many adverbs and adjectives in each sentence.  I felt as if the author was struggling too hard to sound like a writer, instead of being a writer.I then picked up the limited edition of Silva's All the Lonely People, read the first two pages and found myself hooked.  The prose wasn't in your face, but rather subtle and to the point.  In other words, Silva was more interested in telling a damn good story, rather than sounding someone who writes literary fiction for a living.  Another thing I loved about the book was its short chapters.  I hate really long chapters because I read in short spurts and like to finish where a new chapter begins.  You can't do that with long chapters.  Sounds crazy, I know.Well, when I completed All the Lonely People, I had a pleasant, satisfied feeling of having discovered a new author I'd been missing for two decades.  I immediately started looking on the Internet for other novels by David Silva.  Let me tell you, they're hard to find.  I think people are hoarding them, and I can understand why.  You're going to have to bonk me over the head with a frying pan to pry All the Lonely People out of my hands.So, what about the book?  How is it?The story centers around Chase Hanford, who owns a bar called The Last Stop.  An elderly man carrying a box under his arm enters the establishment one night.  None of the locals recognize him.  It isn't long, however, before everyone wants to know what's in the box.  Chase is the only one suspicious of the guy.  For some reason he doesn't fully understand, Chase doesn't trust the old man or what's inside the box.  In fact, Chase turns away when the box is finally opened and doesn't receive the full effect of what's inside of it.  From that point on, everything begins to change in Chase's world and in the worlds of the locals who viewed the contents of the box.The next day, Chase finds himself wearing sunglasses to avoid the bright light he encounters during the daytime.  He can't seem to sleep or eat; yet, he zones out when least expected, then wakes up, and doesn't know where he's been.  He's gradually losing all his memories and has to constantly place Post-its around the bar and in the car to help him remember things.  His wife and ill daughter don't have the slightest clue as to what's happening, and he doesn't know how to explain the transition to them.  He can't even explain it to himself.Tracking down the other people who were in the bar on that night, Chase discovers they're even crazier than he is.  They think something is after them and have no idea of how to escape.  Of course, it isn't long before he starts seeing strange, black shapes out the corner of his eye.  That's when he realizes he has to track down the man with the box and find out how to reverse things.Storytelling is what it's all about, and David B. Silva tells one dynamite story.  I finished All the Lonely People in just four days, which is fast for me with my limited reading time.  I found myself enjoying all the characters and felt like I knew them from somewhere in my past.  I felt comfortable with them, especially Chase's family.  At no time could I guess where the story was heading, which is the sign of a very talented writer.  He keeps the reader on the edge of his seat, but doesn't allow the reader to outguess him.  The prose was sharp, yet clean and simple so one didn't stumble over the words or have to re-read a sentence.  Best of all, the ending was wrapped up in a way that left me satisfied and not scratching my head in confusion.Most of Silva's fiction can found as an e-book, but finding the print format of his fiction is a lot harder.  I'm a book person and like to read while sitting on the couch or having lunch at work.  I like seeing the book up on my bookshelf.  I have to tell you that a book looks much better than Kindle edition.Anyway, if you haven't read David B. Silva before, this is the time to start.  This is an author who needs to be writing again...to have his voice heard throughout the dark, quiet night, beckoning you to stop and listen because you instinctively know something good and utterly terrifying is coming.Written by Wayne C.

1424,1424,"Aaron Patterson, author of a number of popular hardboiled thrillers, tries for a change of pace in ""N19eteen,"" a supernatural short story that is somehow billed as a medical thriller. Although it's far from a medical thriller, the story can be described in medical terms as a botched operation.The bulk of the story concerns a middle aged woman who understandably gets quite worried when her husband is admitted to the hospital a few days before Christmas. However, it's not just the potential seriousness of her husband's condition that worries her. No, she encounters some bad omens that convince her that her hubby is doomed. And it's not just one omen, it's a whole bunch of them. For starters, she smells roses when there's no roses around. That's apparently a sign that someone in her family is about to die unexpectedly because all the women in her family have experienced the same thing. Then her husband has a stroke at 2:22 in the afternoon. That's a bad sign because bad things always happen in her family when the time is three identical digits. And he suffered the stroke on the 19th of December... another bad omen. And there's a mysterious woman wandering around the corridors of the hospital, which can't be good. Somehow, no one in the story walked under a ladder or broke a mirror, but just about every other ominous event that could have occurred did occur.I won't spoil the ending of the story but I will say that it's not likely anyone reading the story is going to be surprised. Author Patterson is going for a seriously spooky story here, but his overabundance of bad signs turns the story into borderline farce. There obviously are some serious emotions at play here as the family tries to gather at the Christmas season to offer love and support to a beloved husband and father who may not be around much longer. A couple of passages in the story suggest the emotional power that situation could have. Unfortunately, rather than let the family's emotions play out naturally under those difficult circumstances, Patterson invariably offers another supernatural portent that breaks the mood. In a story that's barely 20 pages long, these mood breaks are fatal. The story's potentially powerful climax will probably have no effect whatsoever on most readers.The story is also burdened by an awkwardly elaborate framing device. The first couple of pages in the story take place in 1935 and then the bulk of the story takes place in 1975. The woman who narrates most of the the story does so in the form of a manuscript that, in the present day, she sends to a noted author who she knew years earlier and whom she hopes will publish the story if it's interesting. This framing device is awkward and completely unnecessary and makes it more difficult for readers to figure out just who's talking and why the story hops from one time frame to another. The framing device sorts itself out after a few pages, but that confusion also hinders the emotional impact of the story.Author Patterson claims this story is true and actually happened to some friends of his. However, instead of telling the story in a straightforward manner and keeping the supernatural elements in proper perspective, he turns it into a three-ring circus of premonitions and occult signposts. Even if his source claimed the story took place exactly as Patterson related it, an experienced author should have known better than to keep ladling on the supernatural story elements to the point of silliness. At its core, ""N19eteen"" contains an emotionally powerful story about life, love, and the beyond... unfortunately, that story gets lost in the ghostly fog of impending doom and gloom that Patterson chose to create.",1,0,0.59601707,0.40398293,MA

Rick and Jill Wilson are retiring while they are young enough to enjoy their time together. They've found a lovely house in the country, five hours away from the hustle and bustle of New York City. Except this rural setting isn't what it appears. Their first interaction with the locals don't go well at all. The law is sent after the couple. Then like lots of close knit communities, the church is the center of all activities. The couple is asked to attend service...or was that a command? The law thinks it's a great idea.

1428,1428,"Glad Tithings review by Dorothy A. Bell:Five stars.R. E. Woods novel Glad Tithings is a tale all too plausible. The writing, the execution of the story, is that good that it gave me the creeps. I know these people, I've met these people, they live right here in my town. His characters, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are good people, regular, they've saved, worked hard and they can retire, not in a grand style, but modestly. They find a property in a rural setting close to a small community, the setting beautiful, the home comfortable, quiet and serene. But wait a minute, they didn't check out the community. There's a strong church ethic going on; at first glance, that's not a bad thing, just not what they're used to. The stores in town aren't stocked, folks in town are surly, they don't look right. The local constabulary is downright intimidating. The preacher is too effusive, full of good cheer, but pushy.Oh yes, I know these people. They send up the red flag in my consciousness but I rarely take heed. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson don't either. They know something's funny about the town and the people, but they can't put their finger on what it is that puts up their antenna, that is until it's too late. Too late Mr. Wilson loses his wife to the subversive undercurrent of the church. Too late Mr. Wilson realizes their retirement sanctuary is nothing more than a guarded compound. He knows how they're being controlled--I won't reveal how he does this, because it is too great, and I don't want to spoil it for you. But I do think we all should be aware of how it is managed, because you never know, you just never know.R. E. Wood has me convinced there are aliens who walk among us with a plan to conquer. They are righteous, they tell us what we already know but too ashamed to admit; we have messed up our planet, we make war and kill. The solution: all we have to do is live as They prescribe, stay on the straight and narrow, dumbdown, stay simple, ignorant and obedient. R. E.

I won&#8217;t give away the end, or what happens to the Willsons, but this is a great SciFi tale that offers a solid horror story, that will leave you thinking next time you look at a news headline.I recommend this book to anyone who likes creepy SciFi horror stories, based on current trends.",1,1,0.58044164,0.74461665,MA
1430,1430,"This review contains a MASSIVE SPOILER that I wish I'd known before I read this book.You've been warned.I read this book b/c I was specifically seeking a story were the lead characters go snowed in.  I got exactly what I wanted.  What I did not want and what gave me a tight, ""I can't believe this, I know this can't be true"" feeling in my stomach that ruined most the book for me was SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER the heroine thought the hero was her half brother for most of the book.  She kissed him and allowed him to fondle her although she thought he was her half brother.  Due to some plot device, she woke up in his bed, and of course he was so glad to see a beautiful woman in his bed in the morning, that he proceeded accordingly.  She did not immediately leap from the bed in horror and dismay.  The touching and arousal (!) continued until it was going to go one way or the other and *then* she got up.  All the while thinking he was her half brother.  This happened within hours of her meeting him.  It is not the only instance of them making out and basically doing foreplay while she thought he was her brother.  Ugh.Basically, this book had an overlay of seeming incest, unbeknownst to him but known to her, for over half the book.  She struggled with it a little, but not really, imo.  Not enough to tell him the truth immediately.  Who does that? To say that I was skeeved out does not even begin to capture it.  I kept reading b/c ""there was just no way"" that they were really related.  Of course, they weren't, but that bad taste in my mouth never left completely.  I really thought less of the heroine for her lack of honesty.  If I'd known that about this issue, I'd have passed on this book.",1,0,0.574123989,0.047319557000000005,MA

Leah was the product of rape by the employer of her grandmother, whom she thought was her mother. Confusing? Leah leaves Arkansas to travel to New York to confront the man who raped her mother all those years ago. She uses a another man to gain access to a party for the man she wants to confront. While at this party, she finds out the man she has been waiting on is actually his son with the same name. The father had died 3 years earlier.The son spilled Bourbon on her accidentally. While upstairs in a borrowed robe, waiting for her clothes to dry, her obnoxious date shows up and tries to force himself on her. She manages to get away and lock herself in a room where she falls asleep and wakes up in the arms of the son. He thought she was his birthday present. When he sees the bruises that weren't on her the night before, he demands to know what happened. She reluctantly explains. But knowing that James (the son) is attracted to her, she discourages him thinking that he is her half-brother, and sees no point in mentioning the relationship since the father is gone. It would serve no purpose.During the night it snowed and buried them in. While waiting to be dug out and phone service to be restored, James mentions that he is glad he is not Sr.'s son by blood. He was adopted. Knowing this, the relationship quickly escalates between Leah and James. When she comes across his birth certificate, it lists Sr. as the father. Believing she has been lied to and now has committed incest, she leaves without explaining why.James was lied to and been made a fool of by his first and only wife.

No, it was not about incest, regardless of what some critics say. I read every single sentence, every chapter, and it does not compare to what others are saying. This is about a woman who finds out some secrets her parents bestowed upon her. And this is a story about a man that has secrets of his own, that he vowed he would never reveal.Yes, she had the hots for him, but she didn't act upon them not in the way others are saying.

This one manages to draw the reader into a murderous situation via a series of incidences that are described in a way that is in large measure indirect and thus leaves out unnecessary gruesome details.  This book is hard to put down because the characters are so enjoyable. The author very cleverly describes just enough of the main ones to feel you know them a little and little enough of the others to make you want more.  The hero is inept enough to make him genuinely lovable and believable.  A great balance. The style is a bit like Janet Evanovich only set in San Diego.  The story contains its share of evil but is dealt with in a way which reassures me that good is in greater supply.  An easy reading style that will keep you entertained til the last page.

Usually you can feel the connection between the characters before they jump into bed, but this story didn't have that. Like I said the premise of the story was a good one, girl LaCher or Cher gets accepted to Juilliard and is mistakenly assigned a guy Rene as her roommate because his name sounds like a girls name. They decide to make the best of it and remain roommates. They faced a few obstacles which eventually were resolved but by that point in the story I didn't care.

1459,1459,"PLOT: Cher finds that due to an error that her roommate is a handsome Frenchman named Rene.PROS: The story was fast paced. I liked Rene and Cher. It's a nice romantic love story.CONS: It's based on an idea that I found to be unbelievable. Schools don't place students according to names. If they did, they'd spend all day individually placing every Jamie, Stacy and Tracy. And in this day and age of girls taking over names like Taylor and even Michael, it doesn't make sense. It sounded like Cher's dorm wasn't co-ed. A guy spending the night and using the bathrooms would have quickly been pointed out. Also, since they were so loud with their lovemaking, I'm sure someone would have ratted them out. I also found the conclusion to be unbelievable, but I can't go into detail as that would be a spoiler.There were some points I was confused about. Rene says at one point that Cher is 20. This is her first year of school. What's she been up to since finishing high school?There's a section towards the end where the author jumps from character to character. Like the rest of the story, it's told in first person point of view, but it's not from Rene or Cher's POV. It was very confusing. At times, it was difficult to even figure out whose POV it was.While the sex was hot, the prose gets pretty overdone and the phraseology gets weird. For example, Cher thinks, ""I found myself in a whirlpool of carnal delights.""3.5-4 STARS: I did enjoy the story and that's what counts the most.",1,1,0.6635514020000001,0.6635514020000001,MA
1460,1460,"I have a confession...I am Dee Dawning's number one fan. Why, you ask? It's because Dee writes the trash...er, stories that, if I wrote, would float out of my overactive, inappropriate and naughty imagination. French Kiss is one such story, after reading it I had to go take a  peek under my bed to make sure Dee wasn't under there recording my dreams.I think every little girl, at some point, dreams of being a ballerina. My plan was to dance the role of Clara in the Nutcracker, so that  I could save the Nutcracker Prince from the evil Mouse King.  Unfortunately, I discovered books around the same time I discovered the Nutcracker and it quickly became evident that I would rather be reading instead of practicing a demi pli&eacute;. In a recent e-mail to Dee (yes, I did just name drop, when you're a #1 fan you can do that too--don't hate!) I stated, that if men like Rene really existed in ballet I curse the day I put away my toe shoes! Okay, okay enough about me...LaCherna `Cher' Smith, a budding ballet student at Julliard, has just found out that her roommate Rene is not a woman, but a man! And, oh what a man! Rene Rejane, the tres chaud ballet dancer from Tours, France is used to being mistaken for a woman because of his ""dual gendered"" name. So it came as no surprise that he would be paired with a female roommate. When Rene set eyes on Cher he is instantly smitten and knows that he must remain her roommate. Cher on the other hand is not sure if she should be sharing a room with a strange French man, albeit a hot one, but decides to give him a chance; on a trial basis and only after they dance together.The bond between Rene and Cher quickly builds, as do their feelings and it isn't long before they go from being roommates to being more. In my humble opinion, Cher held out WAY longer than I would have. Being the naughty girl I used to be (pre-marriage), Rene's virtue would have been in jeopardy the first time I heard that French accent and had a glimpse of that body.""Rene returned. His hair, now darkened and damp, hung uncombed, but that wasn't what caught my attention. The only thing that kept him from standing naked before me was a white towel wrapped around and tucked in at his waist. He smiled. `Turn your head, ma chere, while I put on my pajamas bottoms on.' ...my mouth watered as he turned his backside to me and dropped the towel. His broad shoulders and muscular chest vee'd into a narrow waist and ultra-sexy taunt buns and that wasn't all. One at a time, he lifted a led into each pajama leg, his shoulder muscles rippling...""No, red-blooded woman could read that and NOT start speaking French! Son obtention chaud ici! Whew! There was another scene where Rene shaved Cher, then spent some time admiring his handiwork...um, yeah I thought my Kindle was going to melt...my panties certainly did. It was just that hot! The story spans the first half of the school year for Rene and Cher, until during Christmas break when; due to a case of mistaken identity  Rene is deported and the couple is separated with no idea how to salvage their whirlwind romance. But, there is something to be said about being nice to strangers.During a sight-seeing trip, the couple befriends a Japanese man whose daughter was also a student a Julliard. That kindly Japanese fellow, happened to be none other than the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. and has a direct line to the Secretary of State ""Heidi Klinton"" (snicker, snicker, wink, wink) who immediately  reunited the couple, threw them a lavish fairytale wedding, sent them on a romantic Parisian honeymoon, and gave them jobs, as an apology!  French Kiss is my idea of a grown-up fairy tale, the love scenes were fumage `a chaud--smoking hot, but the romance and happily ever after was sappy and corny sweet.Dee Dawning is the king of scorching love scenes and moments that make you go `ah'. His books run the spectrum of raunchy smut...er, erotica to sweet romances to political satire, I'm still on the fence on which ones I like the best, but if you're looking for a little bit of all three and get the HEA then French Kiss is for you.

1466,1466,"SUMMARY: An admissions department snafu at Manhattan s prestigious Juilliard School for the Arts, pairs a lovely African American girl in the same dorm room with a blond blue eyed Frenchman. Maybe it's karma, but sparks of frustration turn into the heat of attraction and within the week the pair becomes a couple. But cruel fate steps in at Christmas vacation, when, after a second snafu, the lovebirds.MRS CONDIT'S FAVORITE QUOTE: ""The tour of Ellis Island served to remind me that my ancestors brought to America in chains, had not been fortunate enough to come to America as immigrants.""COMMENT PROMPT: Should college dorms allow male/female roommates?MRS CONDIT'S OPINION: Dee Dawning's FRENCH KISS packs more into 77 pages than some books pack into 377 pages. This novella drew me in from the party celebrating Cher's acceptance into Julliard School for the Arts to the end when difficult barriers have been overcome to reach a classic, heart-warming HEA.In between these bookends, Cher discovers she has a male roommate, Rene, who persuades Cher not to call admissions and get him switched with the female roommate Cher had expected. Rene and Cher tour New York City and become better acquainted, then friends, on the way to becoming lovers. Cher experiences several firsts, including her first French Kiss, from which the story gets its title.When government red tape turns a love story into a story of loss, the young couple's friends and family step up to try to give them what they really want: each other.This is a character-driven story. Cher is open-minded but cautious and I thought she epitomized everything good about today's strong young women. Cher has an opportunity to do what she has always wanted to do and she is determined to get the education required to achieve that goal. Can she overcome the distraction that Rene represents.Rene is a handsome young man who possesses an inner strength that I didn't expect. Cher takes him home for the holidays, and Rene steps up to the task of impressing her father.Ms Dawning makes the main characters and the charming secondary characters work for the HEA. Nothing worth having is easily obtained and this story proves that point. FRENCH KISS is a charming story, well written, and I recommend it to anyone interested in a good romance that is brief but long enough to entertain. There is no disappointment here.MRS CONDIT'S EVALUATION: 4 blissful sweet peas!",1,1,0.649779736,0.56222467,MA

With the species of the were-wolf, were-panther, and were-rat, the team makes a bad azzzzz team taking out crime on all their missions.The author does a great job with all the characters connections between each other, making them a tight net team with brotherly love and loyalty through thick and thin as brothers in arms.  So when the mission is set to take out a female there is no second guessing about the job - that is until Luke gets a look at the photo of the target and a weird feeling comes over him.  Once he meets and has his target ""Peren"" in site, the connection becomes undeniable stronger and realization hits him hard as he realizes he can't complete his mission for he has found his mate.The story is beautifully told as the mission becomes complicated and the team tries to figure out why the person who hired their team wants her dead, especially after they figure out that she is more than human.Peren, a normal weird person she believes she has always been gets an eye awakening discovery when she discovers she has the whole mixture of all the species of the paranormal word enhanced into her own DNA making her not human and finding herself uncontrollably attracted to the Lycan as her wolf trait heeds to the mating cycle.The erotic scenes between Luke and Peren are passionately wild as they ravage each other fiercely.

The story was engaging and the characters were likable. The story is based more on mystery and problem solving, there is one extremely mild sex scene and some mild violence, actually quite perfect for the YA crowd. Though I really didn't get an emotional connection to the characters, or feel like I was pulled into the story it was an enjoyable read. There are times when throughout the book it feels like your being told what's happening rather than feeling what's happening.If you're looking for a light entertaining read with some suspense and mystery give this book a shot. However if you're looking for something you will get emotionally attached to, this might not be the book for you. This I would peg as a beach read, just a simple story to pass the time.

'He' instead of 'she' and Alex instead of 'Dante' ...etc.The only other problem I had with the series was Frankie. She is suppose to be this emotionless, cold MI5 agent. She never lets anyone get close to her because of her  psychic abilities. However, the entire series, she is always leaning or crying on someone's shoulder. In my opinion, Frankie needed more 'tough girl' scenes.

1498,1498,"I chose the public domain version on Gutenberg-dot-org. Earlier reviewers had mentioned a free Kindle version. While as of this writing, it is not available on Amazon, you can find the Maude 1922 translation to download directly as a Kindle file (pg2600.mobi @ 5.2 mb) from the Project Gutenberg site. (This lack of direct access via Amazon happened to me for Joyce's ""Portrait"" and suddenly for ""Ulysses,"" as well as Melville's ""Redburn,"" for example.)One problem is that Amazon lumps all the reviews for different media and versions and translations if it's a public domain title (this happens for ""War and Peace,"" ""Huck Finn,"" ""Don Quixote"" and ""Ulysses,"" too), to my discouragement. This lack of finesse can confound those of us trying to evaluate one against another. Audiobooks, e-books, Kindle texts and print all jostle for attention. For instance, the version above is what I enter this under, and apparently despite the credit, it's not Constance Garnett's translation as the Kindle version!I sampled the first chapters of a few e-book versions. Xanzoc's 1-16-11 review set out the first lines of some translations to contrast; I found that entry and Patrick Crabtree's Listmania one after I had done my own sampling to find what Kindle offered. I wondered how the free version stood up against later contenders.Constance Garnett (1904) is common, alongside the Maude. These two in word choice did differ more than other versions, resembling more each other, and for me, the Maudes get the nod. Garnett apparently left out some nuance in a quick version that nonetheless tried to keep Tolstoy's voice. I thought I'd favor the Pevear-Volokhonsky (2007), promoted vigorously as faithful to Tolstoy's syntax and repetition, but as with their ""Brothers Karamazov,"" somehow its stiffer if more scholarly pace paled. I compared sections in tandem (troika?) with the Maudes' version and frankly, there's often less difference. Sometimes a more contemporary verve enters, but I'd contend the Maudes' century-old take holds its own. (I review P-V on Kindle version under that translation as catalogued separately on Amazon, 8/24/12. Despite the unwieldiness inherent in footnotes, French + German as is to navigate, and the trickiness of using an e-book to go back and forth from notes to text, they do offer in their edition many annotations and maps.) I had read ""Brothers"" in college in Garnett's version and recalled it being faster paced and more engaging then. Similarly, the pair's take on ""War and Peace"" appeared to slow a bit, perhaps for those wanting to sense the Russian itself?Rosemary Edmonds' 1957 translation in an affordable Penguin e-book felt respectable, and this may be a choice for those not enamored with P-V. I confess the different translations seemed more subtly distinguishable than I anticipated. For a bound version, I favor the Penguin 2005 edition by Anthony Briggs (it has maps and notes too, and I like the translation's brisk but slightly theatrical feel a lot). Neither Briggs nor the Maudes keep the French but for a phrase here and there; P-V keep it but translate in the footnotes Tolstoy composed about 2% of his text in French. Without the French blocks of text, both move steadily, if with a British ambiance. Aylmer and Louise Maude worked with Tolstoy on their version, at least for awhile. Americans may not like either version as it puts the lower classes into a register closer to an English/ stage dialect than whatever we'd ""hear"" from those with broken or lower-class speech.I wish Briggs' rendering was electronically available. As it is not, I decided for my Kindle given the P-V challenges to stick with the Maude style, which is not as stolid as we nearly a hundred years later may suppose. Of course, a free version lacks the guidance you'll need. I cannot give the public domain version fewer stars for its more venerable idiom, or its lack of editorial additions, as those volunteers labor to give us the best they can out of their own good will.I read a chapter in Maude. I check in Briggs for endnotes and assistance, as any reader of Tolstoy needs this. But, for a portable e-book, I find myself moving along to my surprise, into a narrative not as difficult as I expected from its monumental reputation. If you read a few chapters past the initial conversations, as with Shakespeare, you will get the hang of the diction and mood. I admired ""Anna Karenina"" (Garnett) when that too was assigned in college. For both classics, Tolstoy's evocations of dialogue and character merit their acclaim.",1,1,0.647577093,0.588839942,MA

Since Selection fans already love Maxon so much, this works out well and it is really interesting to see how Maxon thinks and know exactly what he is feeling.As much as I enjoyed The Prince (since I LOVED The Selection), it's not essential to the plot line. You get to know Maxon better and there is more insight into his parents, but that's basically it. As a huge fan of  The Selection, I ate this short story up!

In this story Maxon's relationship with Daphne seems to be all one-sided, although the story does give a further glimpse into his relationship with his manipulative father and his view on love and finding a wife. The story's only redeeming quality was to reveal Maxon's stifling lifestyle and his need to gain control over his own life. This was probably most apparent in his perception of the Selection, his meeting with America and his need to review the candidate files. I don't think you need to read the novella to understand the Prince, although it was entertaining.",1,0,0.5625,0.145833333,MA

This Kindle edition has 395 pages/5273 locations.This edition of 'The art of war' was translated by Peter Whitehorne in 1560. The original was first published in 1521. This is a less well known book by the Italian politician and philosopher Nicollo Machiavelli (1469-1527). This book is divided in 7 books and is written in the form of socratic dialogues. I copy a few lines from the first 'book' at the bottom of this review as a sample.The edition of 'The prince' is the 1640 translation by Edward Dacres. It constitutes the last 117 pages of this volume. This book was first published in 1532 in Italy, after the death of Machiavelli, it was written earlier: in 1513. This is the most famous book by Machiavelli. He emphasized realism, he found that more important than idealism. This book is one of the most important political treatises ever written, I do recommend reading it to anyone who's interested in political science, history or philosophy. You may prefer a more modern free e-book edition (like the translation by W.K. Marriott). I will copy a few lines from this 1640 translation below as a sample.This volume has an extensive introduction by Henry Cust (the first 10% of this edition).From 'The art of war' 'book 1' (page 71/location 781):COSIMO.

(And I'd like to think it would be a little more difficult to exterminate the U.S. Army)But it has it all; intense - nail-biting action, military research, and compelling, intriguing characters - definitely beyond the reach of an 'over-heated fifteen year old'.

I am certainly glad that I don't have this affliction and can enjoy the story the way it is.This book is not ""reality"" apocalypse, this is hard core science fiction.  Earth awakes to an invasion by alien forces of many shapes and forms. Some are advanced, elite soldiers, some are mindless creatures that crush, rend, and devour the populace. I falls on one man, previously an unpretentious, quiet spoken car salesman that only dreams of a normal family life,  to accept the gifts of a mysterious mentor and become the one that leads mankind from the edge of extinction to the verge of retaking back our world.The many characters are diverse and interesting and most have their own wonderful stories of survival and redemption.  The storyline continues to fly across all five books to a thundering and satisfying conclusion.  Seldom did the pacing slow down and never did it fail.  I have recommended this series to many friends and all of them have enjoyed.I am not sure how well this would hold up if you don't want to commit to the entire series, these books read like a cliff-hanger serial of movies theaters past.

I still refer to it from time to time. I also subscribe to Mr. Gallagher's blog which is full of really neat information. I think that spending $2.99 for a book that has the potential for saving you possibly up to hundreds of dollars is a steal. (And now free is better) Especially if you read as much as I do! I love the blog. It's like a newsletter, with the personal tone Mr. G writes with. Great book, awesome blog. Thanks for all the research Mr. G!",1,1,0.6597222220000001,0.914930556,MA

Thanks to him I have learned a lot and saved even more. Keep up the good work and I hope more people take the time to give good feedback and more stars! $1.99 or $2.99 (I can't remember what I paid at this point) is a small price for someone else to do the work in my humble opinion.,1,1,0.595744681,0.831560284,MA

1522,1522,"There are times when you just need to read stories like this; like when you're coming down with a heavy cold and you know the only thing that will make you feel better is to snuggle under your favourite fluffy blanket on the sofa with a comforting bowl or soup or mug of hot chocolate and an enchanting story to lure you right away from the grimness of reality. His to Possess is pure escapism of the nicest possible order - no doctor could recommend better.The heroine, Stacy, is a rather delightful book expert, sent to catalogue books in the library of an old, uninhabited mansion. Jeremy is an earth-bound spirit trapped in the mansion. He watches over Stacy lovingly, longing to possess her. When Stacy finds herself able to summon Jeremy and give him temporary corporeality, their powerful feelings for each other blossom. But Stacy's generous heart is fragile and her days on earth--and particularly in the mansion--seem to be numbered, especially after ruthless burglars break in and attack her.I don't 'do' spoilers, so if you want to know what happens in this enchanting novella, you will need to read it yourself. I promise you won't be disappointed. I've read several books by this author and am in awe of her diverse talents. His to Possess is rather different from the others, but is just as entertaining and engrossing. Highly recommended.(a free copy of this e-book was provided by the author in exchange for a fair and honest review).",1,1,0.592982456,0.18596491199999998,MA
1523,1523,"What it's about: A female archeologist is sent to an ultra-mega-supermax prison for a crime that amounts to standing in the wrong place. The prison amounts to a lawless warren of caves run by the prisoners themselves, so the official charged with dropping her into the prison advises her to find the strongest man there and offer himself to him, or there's no chance she'll survive. The heroine immediately hooks up with a snarly badass who swaps protection for sex.And guess what, this book is so much more entertaining than you are currently imagining.Pros:*The plot is pretty bare-bones - the heroine wants to survive, and if possible escape from the prison - but it ticks along quickly. I never felt bored or like skipping pages.*The sex is pretty sultry. I mean, for what it is, it's quite well-done.*The sex is an exchange, yes, but it's also consensual. The heroine is making a conscious decision to swap the one thing she has for the one thing she values most (staying alive). The author is able to depict this exchange in a way that certainly makes clear that this isn't a romantic relationship, at least not in the beginning, but it isn't creepy. Nobody is taking advantage of anybody else. (I found it impressive that the author was able to pull this off.)*For a character who doesn't say much, the hero actually manages to be somewhat memorable and sympathetic. He isn't just a giant side of sullen beef as so many heroes in this type of book are, he manages to exist in your brain as a person while reading.*The female lead is not weak. She just knows the reality she's in and what she needs to do to survive, but she's a tough lady, while also being a normal woman who is terrified and freaked out. I appreciated that.*The quality of the prose is quite good. No clunky bits or awful dialog.Cons:*This will not bother every reader, but there's a repeated element of exhibitionism and being watched.*In my ideal world, maybe the plot would have been more complex and intricate. But this is such a minor thing I should probably not even include it! Really it's probably that I would have loved to have the love story unfold more, which is just my inner greedy reader coming out.The bottom line: I know the premise sounds kind of silly, but it somehow all comes together in a way that really works for my brain.",1,1,0.596311475,0.596311475,MA

Unfortunately, she apparently felt the urge to add a myriad of plot elements to this one to beef it up and they don't all work.  This is a pretty standard BDSM tale, which is to say there is lots of hot sex with a little bondage and spanky-spanky thrown in.  Heroine has past trauma that is not fully explained and given what are told about heroine makes it a little hard to believe she acted the way that she did in putting up with it.  Okay, people change.  Hero Dave isn't fully explained at all.  He likes kink and he likes to take pictures of kink.  He's never fully fleshed out and I didn't care about him at all.*Spoiler*  Sqwicky plot element explained.  Okay, I don't know how many times I've read it in this author's works but I've got to tell you BDSM and pregnancy are a BIG turn off.  They don't work.

The people of the nearby town know him and give him his space. He has no problem spending time alone just walking around his land. He is happy with his life.Then he learns of a prison break across the state and quickly realizes his past will be coming back to hunt him down. He helped put his partner, a dirty cop, behind bars and at the trial told Wolf he would be coming after him. Kevin Cusp is on a mission to kill Patrick Wolf and nothing is going to stop him, not even a freak blizzard.Dollycas's ThoughtsThis is a whole new side to Tim Myers and I LIKE IT!!This is definitely NOT the cozy mystery Myers is known for. This is a smart, edgy, suspenseful story with well developed characters. Myers experience shines in writing characters that both women and men will enjoy. The rekindled relationship between Jenna and Wolf has you rooting for them to be together and Jenna's secret adds to the mix. The warped mind of Cusp is exactly what every good suspense novel needs, the perfect antagonist. Then there's the chase and the snow and the mystery of how these former partners will come together for their showdown.

JCarson Black caught me from the very beginning as the ultimate trickster; this Suspense/Thriller addict, if you will, was constantly left saying to herself, &#34;what the hell?&#34; As the plot twists and turns are unpredictable and masterfully strung together, ultimately, the author has woven a web that will leave you breathless and gutted. Laura Cardinal is a gritty,intuitive, doggedly persistent detective; yet, still a woman rocked by the crimes against children, and herself. This makes her vulnerable, questioning her intuition, but in the end....Well, no spoilers here. JCarson handles the hard topics of child predators, kidnapping, and serial torture with dignity and great insight.

Having four letter words on almost every page I read was a total and complete distraction which caused me to be unable to concentrate on the story.

It was a very exciting read, and kept me entertained throughout.Madelyn is a guardian, she protects humans from all sorts of evil things that go bump in the night. Mady is the first female guardian ever born, and is protected above all else. She's carrying hidden scars from an incident that happened three years ago. Mandy just got out of a relationship that ended bad, and is not interested in picking up another one at the moment.Brady is a full blood Lycan, and Mandy is his mate even though she's unaware of it. Brady has been watching over her, as a trusted friend. He doesn't know how to tell Mandy she's  his mate without scaring her off. Brady has been waiting for Mandy for over three hundred years, and he knows now is the time to take his chance.As I stated before this book was a exciting read. There is so much going on that you stay completely engaged throughout the book. I literally couldn't put this book down. The back story is captivating, and leave you wanting more. There were so many twist, and unexpected revelations, that I had to reread a few paragraphs just to make sure that I read it right.The secondary characters were all very interesting, and left you wanting to know what's going to happen with them in future installments of this series. There was also a lot of humor, and heart touching moments in this book. The story was action packed, and had me on the edge of my seat a few times.Brady is the perfect alpha male, with a heart of gold, and a tiny jealous streak where Mandy is concerned.

She is a heroine that I definitely enjoyed reading. I liked everything about her, and couldn't find any faults with her.

When I finished reading The Guardians at 3:00 this morning, I immediately went to search for book 2, but unfortunately it's not out yet.

There are so many technical errors in the book that it's almost amusing, and the laws of physics become mere suggestions.

I was so enthralled with the detailed character descriptions I felt I could reach out and ""touch"" them as well as ""feel"" their emotions.  Murray provides the reader an escape from everyday life and throws you ""head first"" into the realm of detailed assassinations that are only sanctioned as a true last resort to protect our American and the British way of life.  The protagonist, Scott, has such a unique background that he and his Team keep the action, suspense, and intrigue going until the final and exciting conclusion.

1554,1554,"First off, I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. It was action packed, likeable protagonist and a hateful group of antagonist.  It moved along very quickly with a very cohesive plot line and the cast of characters was introduced at appropriate times.So, where did it go wrong?  First, you are really going to have to suspend reality to get into the whole premise of the book - superheroes and villains that control the WHOLE world. It's almost sci-fi in its dependence upon the impossible being possible.  Second, as so many of the ebooks, it's in need of a good editor.  Too many grammatical and typo errors for an accomplished writer.My final gripe is the ending - the story is nicely paced all along, maybe a bit long in parts but just barely, and then all of a sudden, the ending wraps up in three pages!  I would have much preferred a couple more complete chapters to nicely tie things together and to answer some questions that are left behind.  Maybe a sequel is being planned?If you're a McDonald fan, or just a fan of action packed thrillers, you will not be disappointed in this book.

Although multiple scenes from the original are incorporated into the text, you can really see where the seams are.  One example would be grafting a ""Three Company's""-worthy subplot to keep Elizabeth and Darcy apart.  Instead of the wit, wordplay, and charm of the original, we've got Elizabeth turning down Darcy's proposal because she thinks he's gay.  It isn't homophobic -- just witless.The plot, such as it is, is heavily reliant on action.  I found myself missing the acidic and pragmatic Elizabeth and Darcy more with every page.  Instead we've got these second-rate copies mooning over each other.

1562,1562,"I'm catching up on reviews I should have written long ago.Seems like some believe noir should be violent or brutal. Phillip Marlowe is classic noir and so is By Bye Baby.It is dark, gritty and provides us with a glimpse into a troubled situation and a troubled protagonist.Since it is a novella, there is only so much plot that can be described, and I am going toleave that to the earlier reviewers. The plot line is excellent, and while many are tighter, thisone works excellently in this format. Detective Frank Collins almost walks off the page, and the ending, whilecriticized in other reviews, works perfectly for me.As an aside, I have to admit that I shied away from novellas, but I took a chance on this a year or more ago, and it blew away my elitist objection to the form. Since then, I would have to say 1/2 of what I purchase is less than 130 pages.This is a great introduction to Allan Guthrie, a UK writer who deserves to be much better known in the US.

It takes place in England which for someone like me that lives in the USA, makes it interesting. Though I couldn't relate with many of the places it didn't take away from the story. The way that Mr Glenn describes everything, I could close and my eyes and be right in the scene.I am however having a hard time reviewing this particular book. The writing is thorough and complete, the idea is genuine, the content is magnificent, my challenge is putting what I feel into words. There are many authors that try to pull this kind of tale off and never quite make it. Mr Glenn is not one of them. He has delivered an amazing story rich with a full range of emotions and situations that grab hold and don't let go.

1566,1566,"Readers of hard-boiled military strategy and hardware et al will enjoy this. Readers of more emotional works will enjoy this also, although it might take you a bit longer to come to grips with it. This is a book that works on two levels (more, but for purposes of review, two), one being the detail that goes with war and destruction both technological and biological and, two, the intense characterization which evokes an emotional response. This is ultimately a story about survival, about starting over, and to get there the reader needs understand how it happened and why all has changed.I won&#8217;t mince words: I did find it hard at first. I am an emotional reader, so to speak, and thus were the initial chapters too much of &#8216; back-story&#8217; for me, but I promise you what comes next is well worth the effort of staying with it, although you need be a &#8216;tough cookie&#8217; to handle it! And, the cherry on top, those of you who enjoy the war and destruction detail initially, will also be intrigued by what comes next.No spoilers, but expect fallen roads, abandoned hotels and a host of other buildings, bands of soldiers and worse (crazies!), and expect hardship and tribulation as well as brotherhood. And a few epic battles! The author has a &#8216;no frills&#8217; style and it works well for a story that deals with the absolute loss of the frills civilization as we know it brings.

The beginning of the book in military mumbo jumbo which I quickly forgot. The story and the characters are what I really enjoyed. There are several that stand out, a scene with a little girl and her dog, a young mentally challenged boy and his friend, families,etc. This book was a little different than others about the apocalypse, this book starts at the beginning and skips 20 years into the future. You get to see where they are now as a society and as people. How they are living, what has changed. There is government interference as they still try to fix what they did, but as usual, make things worse. Friends who may or may not be friends. Inner struggles and the struggle to not only survive, but to continue the human race and have a decent life. All of this and much much more are in this book. I love these kind of books and always wonder what it would really be like. I think it might go something like this. Hunting, fishing and gardening for food. A veterinarian as your doctor, growing your own tobacco, etc. The things people can learn to do when they have to, is foremost in this adventure. Very interesting characters and a variety of them.

Glenn sets up an interesting scenario at the beginning, and it's obvious that a lot of research went into creating a plausible story. However, In spite of that ambitious effort, I think it would have strengthened the story to summarize the disaster and invest more time following the individual survivors.This is a gritty, bloody tale that looks at characters linked together by family, friendship and circumstance; fighting to make their way in the bleak aftermath of a worldwide disaster brought on by war.When the thin veneer of civilization is stripped away, the world sees who we really are.

There are times in which it feels very disjointed, going from a crisis in one part of the world and explaining the different ranks to another part of the world and explaining what wipes out the majority of humanity. But that was the first part, and the second half of the book gave me a far different feeling.The second section I felt was more personal and I was able to get know the characters much better, and the raw emotion I felt seemed to coincide with how I felt they would feel. In many ways I was there during the darkest moments and their slight glimmers of hope. When The Killing Moon hit its stride it was a story I had to find excuses to slink away and finish the book. I just felt so much of its power surging through my veins in the later half.I am a sucker for Apocalypse stories and after getting through the first few chapters, everything rolled along very beautifully.

I formed an immediate like for the main character, a radio talk show host who accidently ignores just one word from his caller, causing his world to spiral in a million different directions.Marc is a cool guy with a heart who just happens to have misbehaved of late and caused his personal life some trouble.  Now, this caller, slips the word 'widow' into his call and all hell breaks loose in his professional life too.  He wants to fix it, not for himself but for the poor bloke he let slip by.  He intends only to find out if the guy is okay...but ends up involved in a dark and dangerous world of pimps, sex trafficing, and terrorism.It's one thing after another for poor Marc - for he only intends to do the ""right"" thing which just gets him in deeper and deeper.  Luckily he has unasked-for help arriving on the scene.  First, an avid fan of the show, Oliver, a kid who's a little wacky, a little different, bur most certainly devoted.  Second, his true life love, Sam whom he had badly wronged but who is back to make amends.Really most impressive was how 'on track' the author kept the reader.  All of the thought processes that went into Marc's adventures were perfectly drawn out so that there was not one time that I could not make sense of his actions (even if they weren't always very bright!).  There was a lot involved in this story & it could easily have gotten very confusing.

The people she meets become a part of her as they bond together in the harsh aftermath of a disaster of epic proportions.

The author does a superb job of describing the prejudice and discrimination imposed upon innocent victims by our justice system and our society in the aftermath of World War II. The reader relives the invasion of privacy of suspected Communists and daily degradation of minorities that hindered our country's progress during the mid-twentieth century.Twelve-year-old Lincoln South boards a bus travelling from Little Rock, Arkansas to Atlanta, Georgia in 1956. Lincoln takes one of the seats reserved for African-Americans in the back of the bus. Lincoln is a sharp lad with keen intuition, whose mother has instilled a strong sense of right and wrong. Two key players in the story join Lincoln in the back rows. One is an arrogant, flashy young man running from the law and looking for trouble. The other is a quiet, reserved foreigner on a mission to right a wrong administered by the Nazi Party during the war. The foreign stranger attempts to return stolen goods to the rightful owner and realizes that he is being followed by a hired killer. Both men trust Lincoln, befriend, and involve him in their problems. Lincoln's involvement with these men makes him the messenger that will change future generations.This is a very well-written story that reads like a masterpiece.

1597,1597,"22 Steps to the Light of Your Soul is a joyful books that provides far more than just steps. Its thoughts and revelations are like maps for dealing with the unexpected while walking along even the most certain of paths, while also providing key ideas for truly appreciating the everyday aspects of life with greater depth, compassion and understanding.The book is divided into separate sections based on some of life's essential questions, questions that I have certainly encountered with increasing frequency over the years. Written in a meditative, Q&A; style, the book will appeal to fans of Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now, to which 22 Steps serves as a great extension and companion to Tolle's work, as well as Wayne Dyer's writing on the Tao. Having read these questions posed to Embrosewyn Tazkuvel, I feel greater certainty in my choices in life so far, the true motivations behind them and the unlimited potential for what is yet to come.One of the basic themes that makes this book so valuable is its concentration on redefining success with respect to issues like parenthood, love and happiness. Tazkuvel talks about how we force ourselves to pursue these worthy goals from a position of falsely constructed outcomes that essentially ruins our focus because focusing on the end instead of the means will always ultimately make the goal obnoxious. There is good guidance in this book on how to be watchful of this habit, recognize it for the obstacle it is and step around it. These ideas are especially precious in the chapter on friendship, which is dear to my heart because I wrote my dissertation on that subject. Tazkuvel sees the friend as someone to be cherished, not squandered, and gently shows us how to focus on the process of friendship rather than any preconceived end, which must by its nature be false (because it hasn't happened yet) and thereby ruinous to everything that is good in the relationship.I learned a great deal from this book and feel that the reach of my self-understanding has been further freed from the grasp of the everyday illusions that keep us down.

Many parts were much too drug out, and some parts were just plane confusing, it read like it needed a good proofreading.The story would have been better if the characters were older. I don't see any reason why they all had to be so young, in fact their ages were a big part of what made the story unbelieveable to me. Shawnna managed to graduate highschool early even though she had a terrible upbringing and even spent time living on the streets. It would have made more sense for her to just graduate at a normal age and be a year older then she was. Conrad was only 21 and a lawyer. There is no way he could have finished undergrad and law school by 21. There was also no reason for him to be so motivated to get married and start a family when he was so young.  I just did not buy it.The character development was not very good. With good charcters I am able to get lost in the story and feel like they are real people.  The characters in this book did not feel real to me.The ending was also a disappointment, it was over the top and too cheesey for me.

It's set in another place that's like Earth, but it's not Earth.  It's like a mix of western frontier and rudimentary technology.  There's not angst ridden characters who are struggling with their lack of souls.  It's not filled with demons though there are some fairly scary characters and creatures in the story.It's traditional in the proving that you don't have to ""look"" like a monster to be a monster and sometimes, looking like a monster doesn't mean you are a monster.Amethyst is a pretty, wealthy socialite, but she's not shallow.  The story doesn't spend a lot of time giving her background, you just know she's alone, she has no parents, but they seem to have done a fabulous job raising her.  She's strong, sensitive, considerate, independent and skilled.  She wants to go to the Deadlands to look for her estranged and missing sister.  She has the money and the confidence and possibly even the skills to make it out there.  She's accompanied by her three friends, all wealthy and spoiled and maybe not so accomplished.  One who is obsessed with her, one who is in love with her best friend and then her very simple but sweet best friend.Chase is a man's man, though not a man.  He's nursing a broken heart and he realizes, maybe it wasn't so broken, but bruised.  He knows that the human society would not approve of his mating with a human, especially not a socialite.  And he's not so sure she would survive so far away from her world.  He has three packmates with him.  All three are looking forward to the day he settles and finds his mate so they can find theirs.  They're friends and extremely loyal and competent and cool.Of course the two coolest people fall in love with each other.  Of course it's difficult, but they both have the approval of their best friends.  So maybe it can work.  And two groups of beings learn that maybe theirs more to each other than prejudice and they both learn to look past or through exteriors to see the real people within.This is well worth the money.  I enjoyed the story tremendously.  I liked the mixing of the old technologies with the new frontiers.  I like the way Wolven are not werewolves like we historically know them.  They just are.

I'm more of a mystery than romance reader, but I'm a sucker for cowboys (in literature; in person, not always) and Chase is my all time favorite kind of hero. Emotionally deep but he's not really a talker; powerful and controlled, but he can lose control when the situation merits it.I had some of the same minor complaints mentioned in other reviews. I'm a fairly visual person so I wanted a bit more description of the settings and the characters. I don't recall orcs ever being described. This made it hard to visualize the fight scenes, which made them less powerful than they would have been. Also the ending was a tad drawn out and a little bit contrived. But I also agree with the positive comments. Chase's pack mates were delightful, the romance was very sweet and quite believeable, and I personally prefer that the paranormal elements not take precedence over the story. Ms. Drummond handled that balancing act superbly.I walked around for days, after I finished the book, thinking about Chase and Amethyst and wondering what they were doing, like I would real friends who were not around at the moment. One reason I prefer mysteries to romances is that the latter don't lend themselves to series so you can revisit the characters.

1640,1640,"Wow.  I started this book thinking it would be a bit formulaic, but boy was I wrong!  It begins creepy and just gets creepier the more you read.  Such a smorgasbord of horror: kids with telepathy and clairvoyance, not to mention their bad behavior; ghosts, evil doctors and a very evil father, and a staff you don't know are good or bad, are just some of the twists and turns in the Wendover Home for troubled children that Scott Nicholson so deftly takes you through.  The book begins by the arrival of Freeman Mills at the home and progresses through his radical and horrific treatments (and other children).  Nicholson obviously did his research on the science because he is dead on which had me believing this place actually existed up in the North Carolina Appalachians.  I've been reading all types of horror for 50 years and this novel gave me goose bumps in a couple places.  Not easy to do.  It is highly recommended.",1,1,0.576086957,0.576086957,NY
1641,1641,"Freeman Mills is off to yet another group home.  He's had a troubled childhood.  If you were subject to torture by the very person who should love you above all others and were able to read people's minds as a result, you'd need therapy too.  Freeman is a loner.  He's only out for himself.  He trusts no one and with good reason.  But when he finds himself a 'guest' of The Wendover Group Home and is subject to even more experiments that will blur the line between the living and the dead, he'll find out that trust may just be the only thing that will see him through.The Home is part ghost story, part horror novel, and all Scott Nicholson.  Nicholson has a great way of writing flawed and twisted characters, each with their own believable motivations and personalities.  Freeman is the tough guy.  Not willing to be Defender of The Weak or Hero of the Innocent.  He's had too much pain in his life to look out for anybody other than himself.  Starelen is a councelor that believes in helping the kids, not to make herself feel better, but to well and truly help the troubled kids.  Bondourant is a misguided holy man who can't even see through is own faults, much less actually help the children, despite how diluded he has himself.  Krakowski is the head of the facility, a genius to some, but can't even see the damage he's doing to the kids with his experiements because of his own hubris.  It's a means to an end to him.  As you can see, The Home is populated with all types of different characters, from the truly troubled, to the truly selfless, to the maniacle, to the downright evil and Nicholson writes them all with flourish and style that had me sucked in from the very first page.This novel is well and truly creepy, especially when a figure from Freeman's past rears its ugly head to work along with the shadow organization 'The Trust'.  Nicholson has a gift for putting his own flair on the 'haunted house' genre and the setting is a melevolent character in and of itself thanks to his use of vivid imagery.If there's one complaint I had about the book it's the way several of the characters speak, namely Freeman and another 'guest' of the home, Vicky.  These are children, twelve years old in point of fact.  Sometimes though, they read more like young adults than pre teens.  I haven't met many 12 year olds that have used the word 'unexpurgated' in a conversation.  That and perhaps the 'final showdown' goes on for a little too long.  But, those are minor complaints (no book is perfect).If you're a fan of Scott Nicholson or a fan of horror/ghost stories, you should check this one out.  He's really one of the best in the genre right now and The Home is another great example as to why.Highly recommended.",1,1,0.573712256,0.5263469510000001,NY
1642,1642,"It has been a while since I have read a good horror-type book, and I am glad I found The Home - Nicholson has an engaging writing style that reminds me of a lot of Stephen King's work, complete with the not-too-gross or weird descriptions and situations along with light religious shadings that will get you thinking of things outside the context of the story.  Once I started reading this one I didn't want to put it down, and I could see this one being made into a very successful movie that could scare the crap out of you without grossing you out.What I like best about this one is despite the supernatural / horror aspect of the plot, Nicholson explains the and sets up the situations in such a way that has you really believe something like this could happen as well as think about it long after you have read or completed the book: to me, that's a hard thing to do and tells me Nicholson is a pretty darn good writer to have the ability to think back on it a week after I finished it with the volume of books I read and see on a weekly basis.  If you are a Stephen King fan like I am, I highly recommend you give Nicholson a try.I picked this book up during a Kindle promotion for $1.99 vs. the normal pricing of $3.99: even if the pricing goes back to normal, you will certainly get one heck of a lot more in entertainment value out of this one.",1,1,0.568345324,0.530810135,NY

Each character was well-developed - even secondary ones, including a couple of the spirits. I was left hating some, feeling sorry for some and loving some, like the main characters - Freeman and Vickie. I heard this book has been optioned for a movie. I really hope it gets made.

1647,1647,"For a while now I've been thinking that Scott Nicholson was styling himself to be the horror genre's answer to a Sharyn Mccrumb drag queen.  His soft and eerie countrified rambles - THE RED CHURCH, THE HARVEST, THE MANOR - all magnificent tales spun and sung in fine and high Appalachian style; were in danger of painting the man into a corner with a fat mass-market-paperback-sized paintbrush and a uniform coat of runny milk paint.  Like listening to a three-chord Eric Frampton concert, the man was developing a style that was veering towards the comfortably predictable.I don't rightly know if this would have been a fate worse than death in my eyes.  I like his stuff, just fine.  I don't think you need to mess with the flavor of beer, and country mash whiskey is best sipped straight.  Still, the creative spirit is a little like a running stream.  It needs to keep moving to avoid stagnancy.  So I was glad to find Nicholson's new book, THE HOME, demonstrates a healthy momentum and a truly different style than his earlier works.It's told mostly from the eyes of Freeman Mills, a twelve year old troubled youth, freshly arrived at Wendover, a home for hard cases.  Freeman hides behind the masks of old movies, staring at the world through an Eastwood squint, practising his John Wayne growl, a face for everyone but himself.  Freeman has a troubled history.  His father raised him like a lab rat in a series of Skinner-box experiments that triggered an innate ability to ""triptrap"" or read other people's minds.Freeman's transfer has been orchestrated by Dr. Richard Kracowski, who is studying the effects of electromagnetism on the electrical properties of the human mind.  Can you say mad scientist, boys and girls?Kracowski makes reanimator Herbert West look like a warm and understanding human spirit.  Kracowski works for a secret society called The Trust, that's kind of a mix between the CIA, the Illuminati, and the Men In Black.  Of course, Kracowski has his own agenda, (what mad scientist doesn't?), and there are other hands at work pulling the strings.Freeman's doing his best to pass the time.  His coping gives the novel a real Shawshank Redemption/Cool Hand Luke kind of feel to it.  To complicate matters, Kracowski's frigging (technical term) with the magnetic waves has an unexpected side effect.  The dead of the local area are coming back.  Spirits from Wendover's earlier years as a mental asylum are prowling about causing trouble in a number of different ways.  Freeman's abilities are not unique.  A young anorexic, Vicky, befriends Freeman, and shares her secret with him.  She's telepathic as well.  Things heat up when the other children begin developing their own psychic abilities.  The Trust steps up their research, installing larger and more dangerous devices in the basement of Wendover, and things really come to a boil when another scientist is brought in - the father of Freeman Mills.This is a fun read and a fast ride.  Fans of a more ""talky"" style of writing, ala Stephen King and Richard Laymon, will really dig THE HOME.  It reminded me a lot of another book I reviewed elsewhere, Tim Lebbon's DESPARATION, only minus the Kafkaesque angst.  THE HOME is aimed towards fans of Buffy and The O.C.  There's very little poetry in this book.  Less lyricism, and more vernacular.  It sags a bit in the middle, but that's always hard going for any writer.  The fourth quarter of the novel picks up speed and snowballs, until you'll find yourself burning skidmarks in your fingertips attempting to speed read.  A satisfying slambang finale, with a suitable bit of soft teenage angst thrown in.You'll be glad you picked this book up.  I still hope Nicholson doesn't forget his lonely Appalachian voice, but it pleased me to hear him trying on a brand new creative style.I recommend it.  Give it a read.",1,1,0.673333333,1.0,NY
1648,1648,"This is a well-written, psychological suspenseful tale involving deliberate manipulations by well-meaning psychiatric physicists funded by The Trust, an organization hoping to profit by the results of the mind-shattering machinations originally devised by the criminally-insane father of a young resident.  Young children in the state's care are used as subjects in experiments authorized by an ominipotent agency that may or may not be sanctioned by the government.  With the facility's director and social worker devoted Christians, the Windmere institution has been motivated to accept substantial operating funds to allow a noted psychiatrist work with the children in a research project that ""heals"" the children by allowing them to die under the influence of magnetic resonance, a process the psychiatrist refers to as SST.  Formerly an asylum for the mentally ill, the Windmere building now houses only young people that have become a burden to the state, unwanted or forgotten by their original families. Freeman, the son of the pioneer scientist who originated the theories behind SST, has been a subject of such tests all his life, including when, at the age of 6, his mother was killed and his father jailed as the insane murderer, resulting in Freeman being made a ward of the state. Freeman carefully avoids social interactions, and he works to identify options that would allow him to survive the treatments and the specters of former patients of the mental asylum that are raised from the dead as an unintended consequence of the psychiatrist's experiments.  The story holds the readers attention and offers mind-challenging ideas that, upon reflection, are less than possible--but hold enough truth to allow the story to be based on an abstract scientific base.  There are some aspects of the realities that are not explained in this novel, and the conclusion leaves unresolved concerns and much room for speculation, a situation ripe for a potential sequel.",1,1,0.593023256,0.736662107,NY
1649,1649,"""Terms of Surrender"" by Lorrie Farrelly is a gripping and action packed historical novel set in the 1860ies. It concerns the romance between Michael Cantrell, former army officer, and Annie Devlin, a woman who is trying to defend her ranch against a gang of local bandits who want to force her off the land.In a dramatic fight against those men Michael appears on Annie's farm, saving her but getting himself wounded. The romance between them develops as he recovers, but the threat does not go away.I picked this book because of the historical aspect and am very impressed with the way the author has created a very authentic feel for the times. It is a great western story that shows how insecure the western frontier at the time still was and how law enforcement was unable to cope.Anna is a great character, strong and weak, the perfect heroine for a romance in that setting. Both leads have their own issues but they work together as love conquers all.Great suspense and beautifully written.",1,1,0.572192513,0.411764705,NY
1650,1650,"I can't say that I couldn't put this down, for there were a couple of places where I absolutely had to. I didn't want to read on because the tension was too much...for this romance has plenty of action (both in and out of the bedroom) and it was the clothed kind that had me on edge. Of course, that didn't last long - I picked it up again and kept right on reading...nailbiting suspense and all.Annie's brilliant - a brave young woman who will stop at nothing. Perhaps it was my early connection with such a well-written character that had me desperate to NOT see her get hurt any further as the story progressed.Now Michael...there's a conflicted character. I like how Farrelly presented his PTSD - without mentioning the modern term for it. Of course, that's only a tiny bit of the man - for a complex hero, he's another one I wanted to see happy and not hurt.Now, being a romance, I expected a happy ending of some sort, but Farrelly certainly kept me wondering as to where and how that would be possible - and who would survive to the end at all.Brilliant pacing throughout - my only complaint is that perhaps the story contained too much sex for me. Not that any of it was unnecessary or overkill, just a matter of my personal preference.A well-deserved five stars as I go to track down the rest of the series...",1,1,0.547445255,0.456934306,NY

Annie was a bit too head-strong for me, but I guess given the period in which the book was set, a woman had to have some backbone to survive. The passion between Michael and Annie lit up the pages. It pulsed like a living, breathing thing between them. It had me gasping every time Michael made a move on his Annie. This was my first read by this author, I&#8217;ll definitely read more.

1652,1652,"Despite a promising start, this story disappointed me. If the read is rather short, easy to absorb, it is also a little disjointed. But the coverage is beautiful ...Thus, opening with a drowning and a visit to the emergency room from the heroin, I was really attached to my book. I really enjoyed myself while turning the pages. Ditto when she was followed by shadows on her way home. I enjoyed the anticipation. However, once the author presented me the monster, I began to stall. This deadly creature is not detailed enough, not enough to be described as one that should be avoid. And from this point, what had been a nice story began to annoy me.Melissa, who wanted to have a taste of independence became the shadow of Mike. Unable to stay alone, she is always whining and waiting for Mike to help her. A very immature heroine...As for Mike, the reader knows almost nothing about him. Only that he manipulates the girls and he plays with his glamour and attraction. Not necessarily a hero to whom I wish to believe in or to support.In terms of the love story between them, it is very light. Sometimes I even wondered if there was actually an attraction on Mike's part when you see how much he puts the brakes. Sure, he always has a good reason...Big disappointment also with the Twilight's references. If the first one could have been humorous, going to the theater with a vampire and compare your adventure with Bella and Edward, I thought it was a bit heavy.Yet the potential is there. I liked the idea of &#8203;&#8203;vampires, a little retro, who prefer to use tools of the century in which they died and who are skeptical of modernity. It was interesting. I also liked the start but it is as if the author had lost his concentration or if it had not been comfortable with the invention of his paranormal universe.I remain lukewarm and a little disappointed. Perhaps the author will succeed to surprise me in his sequel by offering a more detailed story that will not have you dropping along the way.Lucienewbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr/",1,0,0.568292683,0.16189024400000002,NY
1653,1653,"This book and I just didn't get along. I hate the title. Russian Bear for a m/m BDSM novel doesn't seem well thought out. Neither was the rest of the book.This book was neither a romance nor erotica but porn. For me the difference is in an emotional connection between the characters. If i don't like the characters but am just reading about them getting their rocks off and the story sucks it's porn. That's what this was. mild spoilers ahead.Mischa- the dom- seems like a tool. He's either 'smug' 'self-satisfied' or 'looking pleased with himself' in every scene. usually after hurting Tom.And then there is poor Tom who decides he might like to try out some bdsm so guess what his first 'scene' is? CBT! Really? There was no build-up, no connection and the scenes were just vaguely unpleasant. I'm not sure how squeezing some guy's nuts until he cries is actually BDSM as all the rest of it (ritual, trust, an exchange, etc.) was all missing.From a writing standpoint, the POV switches were a nightmare and as another reviewer commented it's hard to tell who is speaking, acting or thinking because there are no paragraph breaks or appropriate spacing. This is not a formatting issue but something the writer didn't do properly. It was sloppy.And there were ridiculous lines in there. Not cheesy dialogue during sex lines which is to be expected but almost ignorant or poorly thought out sentences. For example, there was a sentence that said something like, 'mischa was thinking hard. and when he did that he usually made a lot of money.' What?I had no idea what these people looked like, they were shallow as all get out and I didn't even want to be a fly on the wall while they had sex which is a shame. Their first two 'scenes' are just Mischa telling Tom to bend over and take it. That's not BDSM, it's gay sex.Some authors like Cherise Sinclair or Alexis Snow/Davitt even Anna Martin's Another Way give the impression that the author knows what they are writing about because they've lived it or done great research and have a good imagination. this read more like someone's purient fantasy.Anyway, I'm sorry to say that I really hated this book and have no idea why it has so many good reviews.

It is the story of Dera, an army whore who finds herself being offered shelter by Queen Isolde at Dinas Emrys if she would agree to help out with caring for the wounded. Dera has a 2-year-old son to care for and having a dry place to sleep and food to eat is the best she could hope for, and she readily agrees to the arrangement. When a wounded man bursts into the workroom spouting off about traitors against King Madoc, Dera volunteers to go and warn the king on the battlefield that he must return to Dinas Emrys before it is overrun by the traitor Marche.Not knowing any of the backstory, this tale would have been more enjoyable if I knew the story between Isolde and Dera more intimately.

Not many are able to capture my attention as much as Hoyt has, especially with a novella. But Hoyt manages to do this again and again.THE ICE PRINCESS brings us readers into the bawdy houses of England and more specifically to Aphrodite's Grotto. They make a business out of sin and Coral aka Aphrodite is its queen. Forced to sell her virginity to the highest bidder to feed herself and her sister, Coral has been a prostitute since she was fourteen. Now at twenty-four, she is no longer selling her body, but men still yearn for just one touch.Men including the handsome Captain Wargate.In a move only meant to make some money, Coral finds herself the object of desire when several men bid for one week of her time. Shocked and a little scared for her safety, she holds her breath as she finds out the results. And in the end, the winner shocks her when he does something unexpected...I thoroughly enjoyed this novella. It was short, but filled with all the good things Hoyt brings to the table. There is suspense, there is sexiness and there is seduction and Hoyt does it all to perfection.

The ending, though exciting and thrilling, ended up becoming vague on terms of the character's sudden thoughts of existence.

1682,1682,It is always a pleasure to read the first book in a series and realize that you have a whole group of books to look forward to. That is how I felt when I finished Before Lenora Wakes. Great characterization and a compelling plot highlight this introduction to a dark world where nothing is as it seems. Where monstrous exteriors do not speak to the true character and seeming innocence and helplessness belies a powerful malevolence. And it is going to get darker from here.

1683,1683,"I figured if I was going to dive into Lee Thompson's Division mythos, I needed to start at the very beginning, and that meant reading his novella, Before Leonora Wakes, a coming-of-age adventure focusing on the boyhood version of Red Piccirilli.Set in 1960s Michigan, Red is a twelve-year-old boy whose only friend, Pig, is imaginary. Always up for adventures together, they see a strange man who not only appears to possess supernatural abilities, but can also see Pig, which frightens the imaginary sidekick. They follow the stranger to his home though, hoping to find out his secret, and wind up discovering there is a little girl trapped in a cage inside the stranger's shed. Despite the menace that radiates from the man, Pig convinces Red they need to rescue the girl. But they've already been warned by the stranger to stay away, and when a new friend of Red's named Amy goes missing, the stakes are raised even more.Red is an immensely intriguing character, complemented by his relationships and decisions throughout the story. The quickly evolving relationship he has with his imaginary friend, Pig, was especially engrossing. At first, it's not quite clear if Pig is a ghost or pure concoction, but he certainly takes on a life of his own and exhibits his own motivations and desires as the story progresses. Red, in reaction to this, is faced with whether the friendship he has with Pig is as innocent and mutually beneficial as he always took for granted.The rescue story really hearkened to those wonderful childhood stories of wanting to be the knight in shining armor who saves the damsel in distress. It's the kind of story that nearly every boy daydreams about at some point in their childhood, with the only real difference among us is the monster we must face. In Red's case, the monster is nothing like what he expected, and even when its true face is shown, he's still unsure of himself and his allegiances.Before Leonora Wakes reminded me of Clive Barker'sThief of Alwaysin spots, as well as Ray Bradbury'sSomething Wicked This Way Comes, two other magnificent coming-of-age tales with hefty doses of the supernatural. It's a little rough around in the edges in spots, like the moments Red spends at home with his parents, but the family dynamic itself is rough around the edges, so I'm unsure how much I can criticize that at all. What I will say is that for a hundred pages of magic and mystery, the story feels remarkably grand in scope and definitely had me eager to read more stories set in Lee's Division.",1,1,0.614285714,0.807142857,NY

1708,1708,"Jim Knighthorse is a character that held my interest despite himself. Somehow J. R. Rain is able to develop a unique and interesting private detective that is complex and loveable. At least I really like the character, who is more than a bit reminiscent of Robert Parker's Spenser series -- cocky, athletic, and damn good at investigating.If you didn't like Spenser, you probably won't care for Knighthorse, a post-noir detective, that is partly hard boiled and partly self-reflective, trying to face his washed out football career caused by a blown out knee. At the same time scarred emotionally by the murder of a his mother at an early age and a more than disappointing father.All of this is set in Southern California's Orange County and Rain really captures something of the attitude and lifestyle of the region that rounds out his storytelling.I recommend this book which was offered for free, but currently 99 cents.

Since I live in the Orlando area, it was fun to read about the different areas, businesses, restaurants, and points of reference. It's not very often that I can picture exactly where a scene is taking place so that was kind of an added bonus to my enjoyment of this book. Aside from that, it was just a really well written mystery! I really had no idea who the killer was. I figured out one major plot twist early on and thought for sure I knew where it was going, but I was wrong! Good twist! This book really held my interest and I enjoyed the dynamic of Julie and Joe's personal and working relationships.

When Julie is the first to discover a dead woman drifting in a swan boat on Lake Eola, the successful body language expert feels an immediate connection to the case. When the woman's death is ruled a suicide, her distraught parents hire Detective Joe Garrett to delve deeper into the case. Not only is Garrett's office next door to O'Hara's, but the two are also an item, though a tragic accident in Julie's past stands in the way of true happiness.Julie joins Joe on the case, and together the two look into the life and death of the beautiful but enigmatic Dianna Wieland. Using Joe's gut and Julie's honed powers of observation, the duo uncover secrets, discover Dianna's dark past and edge ever closer to finding a killer who will do just about anything to stay hidden.Swan Song is a smooth and enjoyable read. Author Lee Hanson is a deft writer and keeps the plot twisting and turning throughout the novel. Julie and Joe are enjoyable characters, and I especially found myself looking forward to Julie's perspective. Hanson has done her homework, and Julie's body language expertise was convincing and really added a fun layer to the mystery.One thing I really appreciated was how the character of Dianna Wieland grew throughout the novel. From an anonymous dead body at the beginning of the novel, she seemed to become more and more alive as Joe and Julie put together the pieces of her life.For anyone looking to snuggle up with a good mystery that will keep you guessing and give you a strong shot of adrenaline at the end, I strongly suggest Swan Song.As for me, when I turned the last page (or, more accurately, pushed the `next' button one last time on my Kindle) I realized that I didn't want this song to end.

The first book felt so much like a simple beach read, the story flowed nicely, but it didn't really grab me on an emotional level. The second book however grabbed me and didn't let go, though still a pretty simple read, I got a little more connected to one of the main characters, and with just my luck he was the first to go, and yes I cried at his loss. This time around Ms. Winchester pulls you in on that emotional level and gets you to care about her characters more deeply. Though the first book is good, this one was far and away much better. I look forward to the next book in the series, and I guess through that book I will mourn the loss of what turned out to be a pretty cool character lost to us forever in the mass of the sun.In this book you will get again a couple very mild love scenes, the insinuation of a M/M relationship (but its not detailed), and you will start to see the more emotional side of our leading lady.",1,1,0.57826087,0.683695653,NY

You read a chapter and go through the action with the characters. Then someone who wasn't there shows up and the entire scene you just spent 5 minutes reading is gone over again - in its entirety - for the new person. This happens several times in the book. There is even at least one instance where the same sequence is gone over three times! Just too boring. I also didn't connect with the main character. I think that the author wanted to make her seem endearing by having her completely inept at using any kind of electronic equipment, having no sense of direction, and being unable to run or even walk without falling down or tripping. In one stretch, the author spends page after page describing her trying to get into bed without falling out. I'm sure it was supposed to be ""cute"", but it just bored me.

1749,1749,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***I don't even know where to start, I had so many issues with this book.1. Feels like it was expanded from a novella length.  There's an over abundance of repetition, both in content and words (pu$$y, no, bred/breeding, essence, no, virgin barrier, beast/monster, no, c@nt, no, no...).2. World building is lacking, the MC's are supposedly not human (and the last of their species) but very little information is given...and what little we learn is not a plus (squicky courtship rituals and child sex).3. Back to the child sex elements.  Call it fantasy/dreams/alien norm, it's still disgusting.  I'm sorry, but there's no way to pretty this up and make it acceptable or attractive...but the author kept attempting to beat that dead horse.4. The Heroine. The reader is provided enough fodder to write essay on the many ways this heroine is not likeable.  By the 1/3 mark I had an overwhelming urge to just slap the brat, and by the 2/3 mark I'm actively rooting for the heroine to die so the hunky hero can move on and get himself a real woman. Her only attractive qualities are physical, and the poor hero is doomed to a lifetime if misery bonded to this neurotic, indecisive, self-centered, potentially psychotic, twit.5. ""C@ck Tease"" - Yet another unlikable heroine characteristic. This term was mentally flashing above my head in bright neon colors almost the entire time I was reading (eventually skimming) this book.6. Non-consent/rape elements mentioned in other reviews? Not really how I would describe it (see item #5).  There's a number of sexual situations where the heroine says no, the hero pressures for further intimacy, she says no again (and obviously doesn't mean it and encourages him again), more pressure, and she capitulates.  I think the author may have been aiming for a borderline non-consensual feel, but it fell flat.  And personally I found it all more annoying than titillating, but other readers may feel otherwise.7. Incest...where?  The MC's lived together for a few years as adopted siblings, over 17 years ago.  No blood relationship whatsoever, and given the time frame involved this didn't trip my personal incest squick.8. At least two elements I felt were given too much emphasis (bordering on OCD) were her virginity and the brother/sister relationship.  Heroine wrestled with this almost every page...ad nausium.8. There is sex in werewolf form, it you find this offensive...just another reason to avoid this book.9. The fiance...what to say?  This entire aspect of the story just didn't work for me.  Why was she engaged to this guy, why did he put up with her, she didn't plan any portion of her own wedding, she ended it very badly and he morphs into a sex criminal...WTF.Bottom line...my urges to slap the heroine were multitude.",1,0,0.65404475,0.053223885,NY
1750,1750,"Oh boy.  I downloaded this little gem and read it out of boredom this last weekend.  I was kind of surprised by the content, it wasn't what I was expecting, especially based on the story description and what it left out (sex in shifted form infers both partners are shifted, and that rape is not involved, at least to me).Raise your hand if you find bestiality, coercive relationships, pseudo-incest (not technically incest but still psychologically traumatizing) and rape, sexy?  If that's you, you're gonna love this story.  Well actually, you might not, because it's really not all that well thought out or written.As a child growing up, Rachael knows her family is different.  They are Amon-Kai, a race of beings of which little is known or told to the reader.  We only know that they have pale green eyes and can see really well in the dark.  Also the males have special abilities and grow to a very large size, and as well, turn into murderous beasts every full moon; that is unless they find their perfect mate, and bond her to him (and while I'm at it, what is with all of this bonding forever crap?  She writes about it in every story, where the woman must be ""bonded"" to the male, permanently.  As tempting as it is to go into a rant about the myth of monogamy (as in one partner and one partner only, for life) and how sick I am of seeing this stupid-ass trope, I'll refrain. ) Then they are saved from their curse.  Rachael's older foster brother, Richard, is also Amon-Kai.  And conveniently, his perfect mate also happens to be his sister.  However, the children's mother is disgusted by the thought of her daughter being forced into a nasty, coercive relationship in which her daughter will have no agency and her son will be allowed to sneak into his sister's room at night and molest her, after she comes of age.  After a fight with her husband, she kidnaps her daughter and they move to a land far away.  Sort of.  Years later, Rachael has moved on with her life and gave up looking for Richard years prior.  Guess she didn't have the all consuming desire for him that he had for her...yet another bad sign.  However, it isn't long before Richard shows up, having finally found her, since he never stopped looking to begin with.As adults, Rachael is engaged to another man who is portrayed in classic Evangeline fashion as weak, smarmy, somewhat effeminate, and up to no good.  No doubt Elise's ""fianc&eacute;"" , referenced in her last book, Revealed and who will surely play a part  in her upcoming book Persued, will be shown in the same unflattering light.  It would be a problem bigger than Anderson could ever handle or write about should the fianc&eacute; be an okay dude.  She simply doesn't know how to bring a couple together without coercion or a bad situation that forces them together, or making ""the other man"" or ""the other woman"" bad people so that the good ones will want to get together.  Like a man who turns into a murderous monster every full moon, and MUST have bonding sex with the woman he knows belongs to him (who cares what she thinks about that) to calm him down.  Not cool.  I would love for her to prove me wrong.  The only reason I bother reading any stories of hers are that I've always seen a spark of something special with her writing.  But I digress; further along in the story, there is a scene in which Richard in his beast form, rapes Rachael, who sacrifices herself in order to prevent him from eating her friend who is unconscious.  This scene was sickening and completely unsexy.  I nearly stopped reading there.  This is the second book of Anderson's that I've read, in which a woman who technically consents but is repulsed by the actual act happening the entire time and tries to leave the hero after because of it.  If that's not rape, then it's something else that's just about as nasty. Just because her body reacted to it, does not make it any less rape.  It really troubles me that Anderson uses that in her stories to justify the male's actions (for example, her men often say things like ""you may say otherwise but your body doesn't lie"" in dubious consent/rape scenes.  It kind of scares me a little that her writing seems to infer that a woman becoming wet during rape, means that she actually wants it.) After this happens, Rachael attempts to cut Richard off and marry her fiance, only to have him show up on her wedding day and seduce her.  Slowly she gives into the needs of her body and realizes within the last two pages that THIS IS WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS.  Right?That the hero would want to force this situation on the heroine, struck me as rather unloving and very very selfish.  It made me dislike him as a person.  If he really cared and wanted her to be happy, he'd leave  her alone.  Or at least quit dressing up their relationship in romantic BS language when this story is about as romantic and sexy as watching a girl get raped by a dog.  But, then again, YMMV.",1,0,0.5921305179999999,-0.120850217,NY
1751,1751,"What I liked about this was that the characters gradually built their relationship.  I do wish that the male character had a little more finesse to him, but that's okay.  Really liked the main female character who was strong and smart.  The ex-husband villain was a bit over the top.This was clearly going to be book one of a series and I guess the author decided not to pursue it.  This is understandable as I'd rather her focus on the more unique Kindred series she writes, but I would certainly purchase the next one in this series!",1,1,0.575471698,0.720432582,NY
1752,1752,"I think the main reason I enjoyed this was because it was different in its story and very poignant. Connor shows up in an emergency room after being hit by a bus with no memory of who he is our what happened to him. The doctor who gets his case is Janine and she is also an empath. Their connection is undeniable, but confusing to this very in control doctor. And so the story begins. She feels his emotions and doesn't understand why he wants her and trusts her without them ever meeting before. Strangers, and yet, not. The story is about how they are pulled together and the reasons Connor is so drawn to her. She has been married and was emotionally abused by her disgusting husband into thinking she was frigid in bed. There are also dangers to her life coming from someone she doesn't seem to know. There are several would-be culprits. The answers to everything don't come until almost the end and are pretty surprising. Connor and Janine (he calls her Red because of her hair) get together for the first time about halfway through the book in a beautifully tender night of sex that teaches her she had all the passion she ever needed, just not the right guy. Connor gently, at first, how to let go and trust him to give her pleasure. It became one of the most amazing love scenes I have read in a while. I'm trying to review without giving anything away about Connor, and believe me, it's difficult. The story is one of dangerous obsessions, passion, secrets unknown and gentle, tender moments between two people struggling to determine why they ""need and want"" to be together. I enjoyed it very much and their pain and sorrow towards the end was heartbreaking. It did seem like there could be a sequel, based on how it ended. Guess I'll have to wait and see. The bottom line for me is that I love a great romance and a handsome, protective man!",1,1,0.567708333,0.6541666660000001,NY

It has the disclaimer that it contains ""poo poo language"", a little  ""poo poo language"" hardly describes what is in this book. I'm not even sure how to classify it, though  comedic erotica comes close. It reads like a bad porn rag. I removed it after 5 pages. There should have been more warning about explicit sexual content and language. It has made me hesitant about buying anything other than a Bubba book from her again.

1754,1754,"Ten-year-old Benjamin Richardson knows how to talk a good game about trusting God and relying on His provision, but can he match actions to words?  Throughout the course of the tale, he faces many hardships and gets the opportunity to choose to accept the sovereignty of God or give up all hope.  In the end, he sees how God works all things to good, even apparent disasters.Benny and the Bank Robber is a good piece of historical fiction aimed at grade school kids.  It's told from the perspective of ten-year-old Benny.Although, in most places, the scene breaks are marked by images of a book, cougar, or horse, there were a few times that the scene break occurred in the middle of a paragraph.  I was able to catch on to the new setting pretty quickly, but this threw me a bit.Nevertheless, the story is engaging and appropriate for younger audience.  Benny faces challenges that are realistic for the setting and deals with them in a way that makes reasonable sense for his age.  He experiences a range of emotions from confidence and doubt to grief and joy.The language of the book is generally accessible for upper elementary kids of average reading ability with a few challenging words.  The chapters are relatively short.Check it out!",1,1,0.585470085,0.533653846,NY

I think it would be something especially suitable for a middle-grader between about ten and twelve years old. The story is mostly simple and straightforward, without many complexities, which is appropriate for that age group.  I liked the cougar-face chapter headings; that was an especially nice touch.  I also liked that it had a happy and satisfying ending.I think Jeremy was actually my favorite character, maybe because he seemed the most complex and interesting, and changed the most over the course of the book.There were a few things I thought could have been improved, of course, but they were minor.  I would have liked to see a bit more action at times, and perhaps a little less description, especially near the beginning of the book, and also I thought certain characters like the boatman on the river used a little too much dialect.  But as I said, those were minor things and on the whole I really enjoyed the story very much.I would recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a Christian adventure series for children.",1,1,0.623893805,0.8119469029999999,NY

I didn't like the heroine, because I thought she was a shallow twit. The hero was okay but a bit of a drongo in that he couldn't seem to realise that he had to actually have some training to run a department store.The romance was not convincing in that the characters hated each other, then liked each other and then hated each other again - and nothing had happened between them except - in time honoured fashion - a misunderstanding which could have been cleared up in two minutes. Of course that doesn't happen in romance books!The managers were unrealistic and silly. Far too many typos in this one and at one time the wrong name was used for a character!The premise was good, but unfortunately the script didn't maintain the fun of the first few chapters.",0,0,0.530927835,-0.469072165,NY

His expertise with all of the regular Kindle regular versions really shines through here.There are many items of which this reader was already aware, such as storing Adobe PDF documents on the Kindle.  I've taken all of my digital camera and computer manuals, usually available directly from the manufacturer, and stored them on my Kindle for quick reference in the field.  It sure beats carrying around multiple books or scraps of paper, as was done in the past.  Yet the author has come up with a few tips of which this reader was unaware, and it's suggestions like that which make this eBook an invaluable resource.As an example: did you know that you can print out screen shots of what you see on the Kindle?  I did not, yet it's clearly explained in just a couple of pages here, and it's a time saving convenience for anyone who would need such a function.  It was new to me, so I tried it and it worked.This eBook has an active table of contents which allows you to quickly reference a topic quickly by accessing the controller or menu key.  This is something that is forgotten by so many publishers, yet it can usually be far better (and far faster) than using the Kindle's built-in search function.  And it also helps if the table of contents is well arranged, which this author has expertly done.As a side note, Michael Gallagher is also the author of the dailyFree Kindle Books Plus a Few Other Tipsblog, and this subscription service has proven to be an invaluable resource to those who peruse the titles of the free book offerings.  Gallagher has done the work of compiling many these ""Kindle freebies,"" with frequent postings, and don't let anyone kid you, the freebies here will often surprise you with their quality of content.Those who have a Kindle Fire will not benefit from this title, as that device has an altogether different way of accessing information as of this writing.

Add three children lost prior to this last surviving child falling ill with same that caused death to others and we might be beyond desperation in doing whatever possible for a CHANCE - much less a cure.This is where the story begins...the final child fallen ill after just such loss (three prior children).  A father done with known methods proven useless strides out of his village and away from his clan /culture ready to do whatever needs doing to save his remaining child.  His travels take him to a shaman with directions and an answer he just needs complete a task (magic enhanced gems).  In doing his task he is swindled (in more ways than one) and makes the ultimate sacrifice for his child AND the other children in his village.  Upon his return and finding out the effectiveness of his deeds, he is subjected to clan law and becomes an outcast of the community.The story rushed through some of the devices and therefore some were thin and unfulfilling to this reader (hence the 4, rather than 5 stars - and I rarely give 5 to shorts, but would have this time).  Though, I was pleased the ending did not alter to something happier just because it could have and many readers seem to prefer such.  It cannot be easy for an author to remain on a course premise wise when it is easier to take the easy way out (just happy it all up).  Kudos that bit.This is a well edited, fast paced tale that explores the human condition when faced with life or death choices related to loved ones and ones we bring into this world and vow to protect at any cost - even cost of self in process.  This is a good advert for author ability, unique creativity with a common premise (self sacrifice) and world building that even peeked through in such short work.Recommended.Christine",1,1,0.590296496,0.70735464,NY

This Kindle e-book was a 136 Kb download (approx. 68 printed pages) and was free a the time of writing this review.This short work has a direct tie-in with her duology, The Kinshield Saga.&lt;spoilers>A plague like illness had afflicted Sithril Tyr's small village... killing only the children. Tyr has lost three children so far and his 4th has just developed the early symptoms of the disease. The local shaman seems at a loss to provide answers or a cure, so Sithril decides to take matters into his own hand and travel abroad (much to the angst of his fellow villagers) to seek a cure for not only his son but the other children as well. Only his travels lead him to find knowledge of things that he never suspected and a price to pay that he's not sure his soul can afford.&lt;end spoilers>JjjnnSome thoughts on ""Sole Sacrifice""...1.) a well written and intriguing story.2.) Sithril Tyr's character, despite the brevity of the work, is well portrayed.3.) a nice sense of pace and timing... with our hero Tyr, at the forefront of most activities.4.) sets up Tyr's character for K. C. May's impressive ""Kinshield Saga""5.) cover art... attractive and eye catching.Conclusion:I really enjoyed this short tale. It is well written and almost takes the form of a prequel to K. C.

The ancillary characters were given a little too much significance, causing the need to bring too many pieces into the final closure. Just as a movie wouldn't seem real without the ""extras"", neither would a good book. However, when a clerk in a convenience  store says,""May I help you?"" in a movie, the director doesn't bring the clerks history into the movie. Ms Outroggeg gives far too much background on each person introduced and it leaves you rather confused at times.

I can also relate to some of the situations that she went through with her horses.I bought this book as I read in the description- animal communication, medicine wheel and of course &#8211; horses, a mix of topics that was magic to me.I found this book very well crafted.  The detail is solid and written by someone who knows horses and understands them.I liked the parts about the medicine wheel a lot.  I&#8217;ve participated in medicine wheels before and always came away from the experience feeling I had gained valuable insight.  The medicine wheel in this story &#8211; The Wheel of Balanced Learning- was one that really caught my attention.  Later when the medicine woman talked with the main character, Jayne, about building a fire I was transfixed by the part about the differences in fire (male and female). I&#8217;d never read anything like this before yet it made total sense to me.I&#8217;m not giving away any specific details about the medicine wheel or things the medicine woman said but they were both things that gave me a lot of insight.

This is a book that really moved me. I got this book without knowing the background of Susan, however soon after I began reading this book I knew that she must have a close relationship with animals.

The turn in the story comes from the very believable Apache warrior who could not find it in his heart to kill her that day and instead becomes her ghostly protector. Leaving her items, in the dead of night, essential for her survival he secretly watches her and day by day falls in love with the grieving woman.  The story is simple and staight forward however the love and wonderful relationship that developes between the half breed Apache and Sarah bring these characters to life and make you care about them.

Quarterback Kyran ""The Rebel"" Black interrupts her plans by escaping from reporters into her locker room, only to demand why their date last year was only a one-night affair. She accidentally gave him the incorrect phone number and they hadn't seen each other since. Now that the miscommunication has been cleared up, Kyran's not going to let her out of his sight a second time and plans to celebrate her birthday with her.Not only does Anna believe she's too old for Kyran at a decade older than him, but she's nothing special to look at and Kyran's been dating models and other beauties. But the bad boy, long-haired, sexy football player assures her she's the one he wants to date and her birthday night turns into the following night... and the following night...and the night after that.When the public gets wind of their relationship, however, Kyran's past rears its ugly head and their relationship might be over before it's even begun.I love older-woman, younger-man stories. It demonstrates that not every story is about the perfect age or perfect body and that each person has individual tastes when it comes to what they seek in a mate. Such is the case with Anna and Kyran. Anna may be forty, but she's physically fit, tall and loves football, a perfect match for an even taller football player, Kyran. The secondary plot with the threats to their relationship made the story an even faster read. It was difficult to discern just who was involved in this plot and what the motivation was.The sexual scenes between Kyran and Anna was unbelievable scorching and well-written. They surely went beyond my vividly imagining them. I almost felt the scenes viscerally as well. Author Frances Stockton's Quarterback Blitz has made a fan out of me.

Mysteries create a puzzle that must be solved with the clues that the author hides in the story.  A magic box and special powers belong in fantasy writing, not in a mystery set in modern America, unless you wish to create a magic world existing alongside or within our normal, non-magical one--like the Harry Potter books.

1779,1779,"In the dedication, R.Doug Wicker mentions his agent -- his ""long suffering"" agent -- ""who tried so diligently to find a publisher"" for Decisions. Were I that agent, I would have, too, because this one deserves that kind of effort.  This is one good read.Even though I'm a seasoned reader of mysteries, I kept getting it wrong. I can truthfully say I suspected who the killer was long before the end of the story. That's because I suspected practically everybody at one time or the other. Sure, I puzzled out a thing or two, but as soon as I had a handle on ""who done it,"" that one wound up dead. Bodies were dropping all over the place.I liked the main character, Donovan Grant, though I have to say he's one of the oddest characters I've ever met in a book. Is he hero or anti-hero?  It takes a while to figure that out.  One thing's obvious right off the bat:  He's a royal pain in the ass most of the time.I sort of agree with the reviewer who commented on how you want to reach in and slap Grant around a little now and then. I would've liked to shake some sense into the guy, myself, especially there at the end.  Why? Because he's such a male, with all his fragile ego hanging out around the edges. I mean what's a girl gotta do, for Pete's sake? Can't tell you more about that without giving too much away so you'll simply have to read it.Most of those who reviewed the book after reading only the sample or the synopses couldn't help but get it wrong. There's much more depth to this psychologically tortured Donovan Grant character than we're allowed to see right away. It builds, along with the almost non-stop action.The author allows us insight into the sadness of a wounded soul, the torment of PTSD. We watch Grant as he struggles under a burden of guilt and overwhelming sorrow. He is confused, yet clever like a fox; never quite sure of himself, yet cocky as they come. Think I can get away with calling it poignant machismo? If you've read it, you'll know what I mean.Is it funny? Oh yeah. I laughed out loud in places.

Aggie does a great job of trig to find a young Mexican boy who does not speak much English, but finds a way to get to the right people to help him get to where he needs to go. sun burns, Montazuma's revenge, fine dining, lots of sodas, and man overboard.

1783,1783,"This author took her colorful characters, Mrs. Aggie Underhill, private sleuth, her friends Betty and Roger, and placed them into a tricky, complex, and entertaining plot of enjoying a cruise to the Riviera of Mexico. She adds in colorful scenery and other details which also invite the reader to imagine what is like to travel to Mexico, and see the wonders through the characters' eyes as they witness all the beauty and entertainment one enjoys when on a cruise ship getaway.Except in this book she takes her characters and places them into tricky and awkward positions. Betty is attracted to the tall man Brice who is attracted to her camera.  His younger brother, Jack the loser, is to track Pablo, who is in trouble and is looking for help. Roger, not being sensible yet wanting to get his money's worth from the thieves of the shipping industry, thinks of ways to ripped off the cruise ship merchants, and he is enjoying himself immensely with that game.Anita, the mother-in-law, is driving poor Mrs. Aggie to want do a naughty actions against her, but she has to be the mature one. If Anita says one more tsk, Mrs. Aggie will go over the edge.Then there is the waitress, the stalker, the grumpy old man with his wife, and the married couple who desired more than what each is receiving from one another. All these characters come together and create a delightful tale of mystery and suspense.Meanwhile, on this trip the author introduces two shady characters and other possible suspects. Mrs. Aggie Underhill, private sleuth, smells trouble and starts to track the shady characters and finds clues to verify what she thinks is the case, but she herself was also surprised with the outcome as they all become enmeshed in a messy situation. There are hints of adultery, back stabbing, and secrets waiting to be discovered in the darkness of the starry twinkling diamond skies.In this comparable but hilarious plot of an Agatha Christie mystery, there is suspense and so many twists the reader had to take notes in her head to figure out the case before the conclusion of the story.  It was an enjoyable lite read, and for readers who like Whodunit Mysteries with hilarious antics and tying up the case in a nice little bundle, this and other stories written by the author are available at Amazon.comhttp://www.amazon.com/Michelle-Ann-Hollstein/e/B004FSAF7Q/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 and as of Friday, August 17th One Hell of a Cruise will be free for the weekend on Amazon Kindle.  (hint, hint) go check it out and see if this reader was correct in her choice, this is an excellent read and 5 stars.In the author's words""After that, she settled down in bed to read the latest book in her favorite mystery series. It was an in-between the numbers book. She couldn't wait to see what kind of mess the protagonist happened to get herself into. A couple of chapters into the book, her eyes began to burn, the lids feeling heavy. She reached over to switch the lamp off on the nightstand next to her bed and finally gave into sleep. She'd just have to wait until another time to find out how her favorite nosy literary character would get out of her recent ordeal.""""She herself was a tall woman of 5'10 with a fairly large build. She was by no means fat, just a good-sized woman. And Anita, well, she was barely 5'1 with a teeny tiny frame and not to mention a killer metabolism. Aggie figured that she had probably gained five pounds just from watching Anita inhale all those desserts at the lunch buffet. And she wouldn't be surprised in the least if Anita ended up losing weight by the end of the trip.""Urrrr...."" Aggie growled.""""Difficult, especially since she couldn't tell them what she was up to in case Betty accidentally spilt the beans to Brice.And that poor boy, Pablo, he needed her help. She had to do something to help that unfortunate boy.Betty slumped her shoulders and scowled. She looked over at Aggie and groaned. Aggie knew why she was sulking. It was because Brice ignored her all evening. And even worse than that, Anita never asked for her camera back before Brice excused himself from the dining room.""This reader highly recommends this author and her many books in this Mrs. Aggie Underhill series; reminds this reader of the younger years reading the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries and others like it. It was fun to find a series to read which made one laugh yet able to use the dominant brain cells to figure out the case.  As a bonus she also is familiar with Gluten diet and Celiac Disease is offering her readers' recipes to create and enjoy with this and her other books and keep their bodies feeling well.

1784,1784,"It is a story, which will probably make some readers sit on the fence.The morality issue of a student and married professor is a common topic and one that riles people. The main character is a typical teenager at 19, the world is her oyster and she will have her cake and eat it. Then again the same goes for the self obsessed professor. There are a few scenes that are of a sexual nature,however they have not been written in an overly gratuitous way, which you often find happens nowadays to maximize and strenghen the commercial position of a book. Instead the scenes take us back to a pre 60s era, before the sexual revolution and during a time in which the people were still stuck in the conservative minefield of the 50s. The descriptions are that of an inexperienced girl and man who knows that. Other than some of the scenes perhaps being superfluous, the only thing I noticed which didn't gel with me was how the letters and the narrative sounded/read as if they were by two different people. The girl in the letters writes like a 15 year old at summer camp and the storyteller is more mature and aware of her actions.Despite the fact I think it is a 3.5 star book, because it could be better if edited down a little, I think it warrants four for making me mutter at the main character. I received a complimentary copy of this book for my review.",1,1,0.52962963,0.603125,NY
1785,1785,"Let me state first, since this book is about an affair, that I personally have never had one, so if you are thinking only an adulterer could relate to this story you are dead wrong. My goodness, where to begin? Letters to My Mother was a book I knew I had to finish the moment I finished the prologue. I read it in a day and by this last half I could barely breathe. There were so many ways it could have ended and I had no idea of how it would. I sobbed through the last 30% and I am not someone who normally cries over books, but like I said...sobbed (That doesn't mean there isn't a happy ending...or maybe it does...I'm not telling and different people will see it different ways). The writing...absolutely breathtaking at parts. Ms. Heath is an inspirational wordsmith. The topic, yes taboo. The love, absolutely, heart wrenching and unforgettable. I only read romance, typically with some erotic elements. This was emotionally erotic, but not hot, so if you are looking for graphic sex scenes, sorry. It was real. So real in its telling I wondered if it was true. I was so touched by this book on levels I liked and levels I found upsetting that I wanted to write Ms. Heath and tell her so and compliment her work, but could not find an address. I did find her bio though, where she states she didn't submit this the traditional way because she wanted to tell the story the way it was meant to be told. Now, normally I find ""explanations"" for books published the nontraditional way, but absolutely not in this case. The crime here is that this book will likely not get the recognition it deserves (I hope I'm wrong). If you ask me...it has best seller written all over it. Not because it was forced into a happily ever after, or because it didn't stray into taboo...this book leaves each reader to draw their own conclusions. I drew mine. I will say I think this book is up there with The Notebook, The Time Traveler's Wife, and other present day classics. Outstanding, unforgettable read...even with the unpleasant truths the author wasn't afraid to tell. Beautiful work, Ms. Heath. I wish you much success.",1,1,0.635371179,0.473313925,NY
1786,1786,"I have to say that I thought this book was wonderful. It is the gentle tale of two people who shouldn't be together by the normal rules of morality and the times. Kate is a young, extremely bright college student who has never had much time for boys. David is a professor at the college she attends. Brilliant but somewhat aloof, he is trapped in a loveless marriage where nobody - not even his children - can see any worth in him.  But this is Seattle in the 1950s, and nineteen year olds don't have affairs with married men in their late forties. Nobody would find that acceptable. And yet, these two find a rare love for each other.As a reader, you cannot help but begin to wonder what is going to happen. How can this end well? It is difficult to say without adding spoilers. But somehow Rebecca Heath has managed to tell this story in such a way that the sadness and the happiness mingle to just give the reader a sense of satisfaction.Each chapter begins with the brief extract of a letter from Kate to her mother - but of course, the letters don't even touch the surface of what is really happening in Kate's life. There is no way that Kate could tell her mother the truth, but somehow she manages to talk about her life without telling lies, whilst at the same time failing to mention the turbulent emotions she is experiencing.I would say this is not a romantic novel. It's a well-written true love story. For me there is a distinction. This book has none of the hallmarks of traditional romantic fiction, and doesn't attempt to put a rosy glow on life and the lovers. It's about real people, experiencing emotions that may not be right, but can't be avoided. It is a book for people who have been in love themselves, who will recognise the emotions that shine through in the writing.Rachel Abbott for the Kindle Book Review",1,1,0.575268817,0.592258064,NY
1787,1787,"I'm going to up the ante for the reviewer who wanted to give only Six Stars:-)I really don't even know where to begin. I didn't read the reviews, just downloaded this because it was free and I thought the title was a wonderful play on words. Had no idea what I'd done when I opened it and started reading. Literally could not stop reading. Stayed up all night. Tried to put it down once to sleep, but couldn't. Only went to the bathroom once, although that's more info than you probably needed.I've read thousands of books in my life; have an extensive library of everything from classics to fiction to history to autobiography; and I have never ever in my life read anything like this. It is chillingly brutal, but not graphically. It is frenetic, nonstop, full-on, in your face gritty realism with the most beautiful metaphors and witty plays on words; a head full of characters, each of whom you will love; and a prose that is astounding. When I have to stop and use the ""dictionary"" feature, that says something.Even though I finished it, I'm having a hard time not opening it again today, just to go back and highlight some of the more astounding similes and metaphors; but then, I'd be highlighting every page.

1788,1788,"Though the description says ""Sister of the Bride"" is 400 pages long,  that is just not possible:  this is a short novella, not a full length book.That said, even for a novella it is eminently forgettable.  There is no tension between H/h, no obstacles to their relationship and it is essentially a boy-meets-girl-and-they-get-engaged story (in an unbelievable 3 days!!!) with no angst and very little to keep the reader's interest.  And there are strange editing issues, as if the author forgot the physical details  of what her heroine looked like.

1789,1789,"A jaw-dropping, eye-popping opening murder sets the tone for this graphically violent mystery. Original and intricate, this plot with its many twists and turns keeps the pages flying by. Alternating viewpoints between the protagonist, Jack Harden, and the serial killer, Eddie Carter, Huffstetler creatively develops Jack's motivations as a lawman and offers a glimpse into Eddie's psychopathic mind. Dry, witty banter and challenging situations spark the chemistry between Jack and Elise, lightening the mood within this intense mystery. Advancing the plot, well-developed secondary characters complement Jack's hunt for the killer. The potent combination of Jack tracking and matching wits with a psychopathic killer creates a high-octane mystery that will keep the reader breathless right up to the thrilling climax.I was provided a copy of the book by BTS eMag for purpose of honest review.

1794,1794,"As the title ""SMART SCHOOL TIME RECIPES: The Breakfast, Snack, and Lunchbox Cookbook for Healthy Kids and Adults"" makes clear, this eBook is mainly aimed at parents who want to create healthy but quick breakfasts and lunches for their tikes. However, it's great for anyone who never seems to have enough time in the morning before they rush off to work or for employees -- especially teachers like me! -- who need to eat in a rush or at their desk. Not all of the recipes are golden, but that's true of any cookbook -- even my two favorites,20-minute Menus - Time-wise Recipes & Strategic Plans For Freshly Cooked Meals Every DayandEating Well Is the Best Revenge, both by Marian Fox Burros.The recipes are geared to the &uuml;ber healthy -- only one recipe contains real milk, most of these recipes are vegetarian or vegan, there's very little in the way of even whole-wheat flour, and the like. (That's not surprising as the author and the other contributors tend to be dairy- and gluten-free.) However, all are easily adaptable to how you and your family likes to eat. Can't stand the thought of spelt flour? (Count me in that club!) Then you can easily switch to whole-wheat or even all-purpose bleached flour. The thought of grinding blanched almonds to make your own blanched almond flour when you have so many papers to grade is making your skin crawl? You can easily substitute whatever you normally use. The same goes for vegan mayonnaise, quinoa pasta, sea salt, soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, garbanzo bean flour, tofurky, and the rest.It's got a lot of great healthy recipes that would appeal to families that don't subscribe to any special diets or aren't even particularly health conscious: Frosted Cherry ""Pop-Tart"" Pancakes, Pear and Raspberry Breakfast Crumble, White Bean Dip, Lentil Carrot Stew, various bulgar salads, Chicken and Avocado Salad, Take-Along Taco Bar, Veggie Packed Sloppy Joes, Corndog Muffins, and more. And anyone who has eaten at P.F. Chang's will love the P.F. Chang's China Bistro Chicken Fried Rice.Some of the recipes are really money savers, too: Making your own instant oatmeal packets, taco seasoning, pesto, Honey Mustard Chicken Strips, and Caesar salad dressing.One caveat: ""Smart School Time Recipes"" DOES NOT have a table of contents. However, you can make your own by bookmarking the beginning of each section and then highlighting the titles of the recipes you'll be using.

Only because reading this first would have helped me while reading it, this sets that book up PERFECTLY!!! I read a few reviews already for Legacy of the witch and one said that this enovella had to many holes, well Mark of the Witch fills in every single one of them. So if you felt that way as well at the end of this novella go preorder Mark of the Witch now and I promise you won't feel that way aftr you get your hands on it.It's hard to review this alone and not intertwine it with book 1 but I'm going to try. In Legacy of the witch you will see how Maggie sets up the story that will be the main plot for the whole series. We also get to see how Maggie is presenting us with the writing style she is going to use throughout the whole series, which is fabulous.One thing I must point out is that she blends the character and their previous lives perfectly, as the main characters get visions or memories revealed to them it helps the main character put the story together as you are reading it. So you get to discover it WITH the character.I have been waiting for this series for a very long time and I am extremely happy with it, Legacy will leave you lustful and hungry for Mark of the Witch and Mark of the Witch left me begging Maggie and asking her who I had to sell my kidney to in order to get book 2 now.I recommend The Portal Series for any reader looking for something I haven't seen in a witch paranormal based book before. It's been said a million times before and I can imagine a million times more after the rest of these books are released, Maggie knows how to cast a spell on her readers that has you missing the feel of her books in your hand.I give this enovella 5 out of 5 stars, and now I'm going to retread Mark of the Witch again.Charity Costa ~Bewitching BellaEmissary of Literal Addiction & proud member of Maggie Shayne's Official Street Team & most importantly a die hard fan of all things Maggie Shayne",1,1,0.569047619,0.78452381,NY

1814,1814,Great way to get readers wanting more thats for sure. I know I'll be reading the next book in the series pretty soon. The ending left me wanting to know what happanes just like any good book should.I recommend to read this and than like I will be doing go on to the next in the series.,1,1,0.606557377,1.0,NY
1815,1815,"I was lucky enough to get Legacy of the Witch as a kindle freebie. I enjoyed Legacy of the witch even though it was a quick little story with just the promise of romance rediscovered (from a past life.) The short also laid the foundation of the past life events for the leads in the first full length story in this series, Mark of the Witch, (and I am assuming for the rest of the book to come as well.)  I wish I had been lucky enough to read this prequel before I read Mark of the Witch though, because I suspect that I might have liked Mark of the Witch better if I'd read this prequel first, because the prequel makes it pretty clear who the bad guy is and the first book keeps you guessing (which made it hard to root for that heroine or taht hero either.)",1,1,0.606060606,0.868686869,NY
1816,1816,"Legacy of the Witch is today's selection. First off it's a novella that introduces a new series that has to do with witches. Perfect for this time of the season, since Halloween is just around the corner. So here's what the novella is about:We meet up with a 13 year old Amarrah who's grandmother is about to pass on to the next chapter of her life. A flower way of saying she's dying. All her life she has been told of stories of about these witches, but they are not just stories. Amarrah and these witches lives have been entwine with each other over many lifetimes.Now Amarrah will become the keeper of the box. However, when she is about to leave Iraq for the states she ends up losing the box. Heartbroken that she has let her grandmother down. Life moves on and she sees the box again.  Life has given her a chance to reclaim the box.In order to reclaim the box she meets Harrison Brockson who had manage to get the box. Now Harrison and Amarrah need to get the box from his ex-fiancee. Will they succeed? Will the future of the three witches come to a happy ending? Well, I guess you will be coming along with me on this journey, because I don't know the answer. I just know how it all started.I'm excited to see if they all can have a happy ending. The first book in the Portal Series will come out in October. After reading this novella I'm sure that we will find an action pack adventure awaiting us. I hope you will come along with me on this journey. So, far I like the start and eager awaiting the next installment.",1,1,0.547692308,0.773846154,NY
1817,1817,I too wish that I had read this book before Mark of the Witch as I had already read a ARC of that book. The only reason I say that is because a lot is explained in this book that ties perfectly with Mark of the Witch. This book is for sure a FANTASTIC intro into this series and I can't wait for the rest of this series to come out. Maggie Shayne has the ability to lure you in and just keep you wanting more and more. If anyone had any doubts after reading this book I say give the next book a try at least. You will not be disappointed in the least bit.,1,1,0.520325203,0.5922764229999999,NY
1818,1818,"This was an awesome prequel to the Portal Series.  Had everything needed in a teaser and it was hard to put down.I loved the characters of Amarrah and Harrison.  The connection and bond that's lived over so many of their lives was amazing.  It was great reading about Amarrah's visions from her past life, which made it easier to understand how they met each other and fell in love. And how ""the treasure box"" came into the story, the history of it, and its significance.Maggie did an excellent job in bringing in the opening to the Portal series and the 3 major witches, Indira, Magdalena and Lilia, and their history.  Really set up the story and made it so interesting, you wanted it to keep going right into the first novel.I am not new to Maggie Shayne and her work, and was so excited that this was coming out.

1820,1820,Even though I am not that big of a fan of Witch books I have to agree with others that have read this book it is another great book from Maggie Shayne.

1821,1821,"I have read many of Maggie Shayne's books, and this did not disappoint. Fast-paced and full of adventure, it was a quick and enjoyable read. It has just enough suspense and intrigue to keep you hungry for more at the end. Which is great, since it's the first of a series! If you're interested in witches, romance, past lives, or just looking for something beyond the everyday, this is the book for you! The best part was that it was a free download!

1822,1822,"So I was not sure what to expect when picking this book up, it actually took me a second to realize it was a prequel to a book I was already reading, so of course I stopped reading that and focused on this book alone.I have been a fan of Maggie Shayne for a while now. This book wasn't a let down when it came to expectations.Reincarnation can be a tricky subject to brooch because you don't know which life to give the most attention to and often I have found the books containing such subjects lacking, this was not the case in Legacy of a Witch.I loved that the love the two main character's felt would travel with them through their life time's and destiny draws them together.It is interesting to see how things  start out and it is a book well worth the read.Favorite Quotes:""It was my first kiss. And I heard a whisper inside my mind, a vow. I will never forget this moment, this feeling, not even if I live a thousand thousand lifetimes.""",1,1,0.5459183670000001,0.805393586,NY

The character is from the middle east, the book starts there & has flashbacks to there. It's a lucky thing we were told this because the flow of the writing & character has a very American feel, she doesn't watch TV, but she was watching a show.... You know I could pick this book to pieces but then I'd be wasting your time & mine & I've wasted to much time on this book. I'm shocked it ever made it to a series.",0,0,0.611940299,-0.097014925,NY
1824,1824,"Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogNot knowing what to expect of this series, this prequel was the perfect teaser.  A touch of the Middle East, legends, witches and a magical box.  This series is shaping up to be a very interesting read.Amarrah's grandmother used to tell her stories from long ago about three witches in the king's harem, and how they could never find love.  Except Amarrah knew these stories, because she had been there and lived through them.  On her deathbed, her grandmother puts her in charge of guarding a box from those times, a box without a lock that cannot be open.  But Amarrah quickly loses it.  Now years later, while Amarrah has made a life for herself in American and forgotten a lot about those stories, the box reappears and turns her world upside down.  And it brings her to Sergeant Harrison Brockson.Amarrah is a character I can grow to like.  She didn't do much for me other than the fact that I could see her determination to get the box back and not fail her grandmother, at any cost.  Harrison is hot, in a alpha, men in uniform, kinda way.I loved the flashbacks that Amarrah has.  They serve the purpose of giving the reader a good glimpse into the witches and what the series is about, but they also serve the purpose of showing you the connection between Amarrah and Harrison.  A connection that has lasted through times and even though they are different people today.Then there's the box.  The box has me very intrigued.  What power does it have?  What is Amarrah's mission with the box?  And obviously it has power because other people want it as well.I can't wait to dive in and start reading the first book in this series.  I am very curious if it will be Amarrah's journey or if the books will focus on bringing happiness to the witches that were denied then.",1,1,0.561307902,0.561307902,NY

1826,1826,"The Elantra books have been sitting on my shelf for a while.  I own four of the seven currently out and I keep meaning to read them, but something always comes up.  I like Sagara (who also writes under the name ""Michelle West"").  Her Sun Sword books were some of the first long fantasies I read independent of my father's book shelves (I picked up the first two the same day I picked up Janny Wurts ""Daughter of the Empire"" trilogy) and part of why I love politics in fantasy books today.The Chronicles of Elantra are a different beast.  Lots of fantasy, lots of gutsy women...less of the politics I loved in the Sun Sword books.  Well when I saw this up for sale independent of the anthology it was part of (Harvest Moon), I figured why not give it a try?  Its a prequel, depicting the Elantra books main character Kaylin's first introduction to the Hawks.I enjoyed this.  I kind of doubted Kaylin's age (she's meant to be 13), she doesn't react like any 13 year old I've ever met or read about.  Her reactions are measured--even when in extreme pain she barely let's it show.  Her distrust is monumental, but her loyalty is just as fierce.Some of it is cute--Clint (an Aerian, he has wings) having a soft spot for orphans like Kaylin, Caitlin's warm efficiency as she tries to get Kaylin started out, Teela's vicious sense of humor.  But this is a violent novella that deals with kids being hurt, so it sometimes was jarring.The series proper is set 7 years later, when Kaylin is 20 and is a full fledged member of the Hawks (a sort of elite militia/police that patrol and protect Elantra) so I imagine her interactions with people are more frequent.  She spends much of this novella either bitterly accusing folk, depressingly silent or reluctantly helpful.I think as a taste of the world of Elantra this was a good start.  We get an idea of the hierarchy, some of the magic system, what makes Kaylin (almost too) special and a lot about the people.",1,1,0.644768856,0.8815896190000001,NY
1827,1827,"I am usually not a fan of short stories but as this within the Cast In series it was really a must buy.  It gives us another glimpse into Kaylin's back story.

Also, I know this world now.  It just glows.You feel for Kaylin with every page.  Thequality is Michelle's writing has you laughing and other times you are close to crying.

They read as real; real peoples, real concerns, real crimes, and a very, very real heroine.I understand Kayla's dilemmas, her hopes, her nightmares & her dreams.  There is no way to just set the book aside & go do something else.  All of the entries in this series are compelling.  The pace is fast, the world complex, the political twists are on the level of the original Dune (and not nearly as slow a read).Each book builds on what has come before, I cannot imagine not owning the entire series.. nor can I wait for the next release.Well worth the money & the time.

1829,1829,"I have read every thing that Lackey has written and I have yet to find one I do not like. She is right there with Andre Norton and  Marion Zimmer Bradley. This book plays with 5 hundred kingdoms and the gods of Greece and Rome and the Godmothers. The only thing I did not like was all the gods names as they jumped around. There is a lot of funny stuff to laugh at and good things to think about, for we are much like the gods. We do not know how to survive in a crisis when all our food is cut off by other things. Kids think they just go to the grocery store and have no idea how to raise crops to feed people which is the main plot of the story.",1,1,0.531468531,0.45337995299999995,NY
1830,1830,"There aren't many new books being written that are set in the 80s. At least not one sthat are done so well---from fashion to news headlines.  It was in interesting twist on a good story.  I found myself wondering how these characters have survived the next 30 years to the present day---from our heroine and her prince to Don and Pierre.  I guess that means the author has done a very good job of creating very real characters.Unlike most ""romance"" stories this one isn't so much about the journey that our main characters take together but rather is about the journeys that bring them together.  Most of the story doesn't have anything to do with their relationship together. There was a lot of backstory in both of their lives to get through before they could meet in a meaningful way.  There wasn't a lot of drama and action, but there was a lot of real emotion.

1831,1831,"Ms. Wade, WOW, that's my feeling right now, after reading  your book.  I too was a single mother of a 3 yr old once upon a time and I had to place my child in the care of someone else, while I went to work.  I tell you, one of my biggest fears was something happening to my daughter while in someone else's care.  Fortunately, I was blessed and found a center that was excellent, but there are many centers that don't deserve a license.  Childcare is big business now days and some owners will cut corners for the almight dollar.  The regulations should remain strict, with a better check and balance system in place to avoid the scenerio portrayed in your story.  I found myself holding my breath throughout the book, wondering what was going to happen next.The relationship between Austin and Catrine was brought back on point, but it was sad that something tragic had to take place for them to come back together again, realizing how immature they both were in the past.  Even though Mona had been abused both mentally and physically in her youth, her issues with mental illness remained. It is a disease that is taken too lightly.  More research needs to happen, which may help in the development of medication that can bring balance to those affected.  I will be reading more of your work.",1,1,0.579150579,0.7661947659999999,NY
1832,1832,"One thing the other reviews have not mentioned is the pretty significant use of prayer and religious convictions espoused throughout the book. Also, I found it difficult to endure the side-tracks of story for historical context when, for example, she is supposed to be rushing to the childcare center to find her son! Seemed to happen quite often that the story was interupted by historical scenes for the characters. Creates a halting/disrupted flow for me.

1853,1853,"This is the story of a post (and continuing) apocalyptic planet with space stations as places people live to escape the planet Earth.  Great idea overall.There are action bits, bombs, running, killing, evil plots and good people.  So, there is a lot to the story.  Too much in fact. The insertion of everything imaginable (life, death, human engineering, enhanced people, natural people, alien types, mystical types, mutants, ghosts, goddesses, men plotting overthrow of government, Marshall law, love story, sex, nuclear war, space travel and fights, supernatural events and so on).  Due to so many plot devices, the story flow was rushed, overdone in some spots, incomplete in others.  And led to a lot of jumping around in tale that really (while ended) did not flow in cohesive /cogent manner with regard to story arc development overall.The contridictions of characters was just conveniently explained away without direction.  Just plopped into story via a tell vehicle when needed as was not in keeping with initial characterizations at onset of meeting character.  Or, not explained at all (why not all girls or women who met the goddess did not have hair color change - just two?  Why only one of those two branded with tattoo?  Those type inconsistencies never addressed.  We just need accept them...).  The guy was pretty accepting of kiss without real reason behind it.  ""No reason honey?  Oh, well then, okay.

1861,1861,"After reading ""848"" (Dark Bites, Part 4) and being very impressed by the author's writing and storytelling skills, I was eager to read ""Windy City of the Dead"", and also because I'm a big fan of zombie- and post-apocalyptic books.This short story isn't so much a post-apocalyptic novella, but is mainly centred on the zombie-theme, which of course, I enjoyed immensely. If you're looking for a story with depth and characters you can relate to, then give this one a miss. What I liked most about ""848"" was that I felt sorry for the main character, but in this story I felt absolutely nothing for the chain-smoking protagonist. I didn't like or dislike her, but at least she was fearless and I admired her courage.Of course my favorite parts of the plot were the zombie-bashing, but the bit in the story that freaked me out the most, amongst others - and which had me glued to the pages - was the little undead girl terrorizing the main character who is trying to make her escape from the 52nd floor of her apartment building with the lights constantly going out.If blood, guts, splattering brains, mechanical clown toys, and a katana-wielding woman don't give you the heeby jeebies, then go ahead and spend a worthwhile fifteen minutes of your time reading this suspenseful, gore-drenched novella.

1866,1866,"At first glance No Rest for the Wicca seems like your run-of-the-mill indie book. The cover isn't an eye catcher but the synopsis had potential in my eyes and is the main reason why I added it to my to-be-read pile. After reading the first few pages I realized that this novel was going to be ""one of those"", a story that I just couldn't put down! Lovable characters, heart-pumping action and great world-building make this book a must read.My favorite part by far was Morgan. She's an amazing character with a past that's just as colorful as her present. At first, she turns down the chance to work on a special assignment that's offered to her but when her cousin's life is threatened she quickly reconsiders. I can't help but admire someone who's willing to fight tooth and nail for those they love. Morgan had locked her voodoo half away after a previous mistake on the job but forces herself to revisit it. She's incredibly hard-headed, fiercely independent and never walks away from a fight. One of the things about her personality that made me love her even more was the fact that she doesn't believe in being promiscuous. Too many urban fantasy heroines jump into bed within the first few chapters of a book but not Morgan. Don't get me wrong, I love r-rated action as much as the next girl but it's nice to come across a protagonist with strong morals with regards to sex for a change.The storyline is equally as captivating. It's well developed and Toni LoTempio does an excellent job of tying up all of the lose ends. Things that I'd forgotten about or disregarded as trivial came into play in the final chapters. The author's attention to detail is admirable! The murder investigation side of the plot transformed the book into a real page turner. Just when I thought the case was solved all neat and tidy like things blow up and nothing is as it seems. LoTempio skillfully steers the investigation into a different direction, one that I didn't see coming but ends up making perfect sense. Well played!Cole is another great character. At first I disregarded him and thought that he was a jerk. But after he and Morgan become partners we start to see that there's more to St. John than meets the eye. He's a vamp but with a few added twists on the standard breed. Cole and Morgan eventually do get it on so don't worry. Her resistance efforts were admirable but I was happy when she gave in. I know, I'm contradicting myself. I don't like the female lead to jump into bed too easily but I still do want her to get it on... eventually!I only touched on my favorite aspects of this book but there are plenty more. I strongly encourage you to read No Rest for the Wicca and discover your own preferred elements. Don't be put off by the cover, this book has a lot going for it and it would be a shame for you to miss out on this jem because of a decision that's based only on your first impression.

1873,1873,"The story of who murdered liquor store owner, Manny, and now threatens the life of high school teacher, Jessie Jones, could have been an interesting tale in the hands of a capable author.  Unfortunately, what we have here is an inane full length book that should have been a short story at best.  It is 5% story and 95% filler fluff.I keep asking myself WHEN novice story writers will cop to the fact that page after page of painful inner dialogue by the main (or any) character is a sure fire way to make any book a big fat zero.This 'book' is all over the place.  The author would have done well to sit down prior to writing and compose an outline as to what the main theme of the book would be and then FOLLOW that outline.  There is so much ridiculous, extraneous activity going on that it is close to impossible to follow what I took to be the main point of the book: the murder of Manny and the protagonist's unwilling involvement in the crime.In one scene you have some silly mishmash about an upcoming wedding, in several others you have Jessie doing battle with the big 'meanies' in her life...characters, by the way, who are so one dimensional as to be laughable.  In other scenes she is agonizing over a long dead romance (ten years) when her erstwhile lover turns out to be lead investigator on the murder at hand.These characters insult the reader's intelligence mercilessly.  Are we really supposed to believe that Jessie, after narrowly escaping death and then having her house torched, lists wearing a hideous maid of honor dress in her sister's wedding as one of her top three current concerns?  Give me a break.Another idiotic character is that of Jessie's mother.  This is a woman who supposedly made her way through medical school and became a respected surgeon while at the same time raising two children and yet whose main focus is getting her daughters married off.  The mindset just doesn't jibe.I find myself skipping page after page after page of imbecilic tripe just to get to the next coherent passage that might just relate to the mystery at hand.I'm afraid that whomever murdered Manny will have to remain a mystery to me because I've lost all patience with this miserable excuse for a book.",1,0,0.581018519,0.059854497,NY

Cheyenne Red Wolf was raised by her mother and Native American step-father, and even though she is as white as a crayon (red hair and blue eyes, as well) she has tried her whole life to be the dark haired, dark eyed Native American girl she has always wanted to be and not just by adoption and name. She thoroughly shocks Azrael Thunder Horse, who is the man who hired her by name and resume alone, to teach the Native American Studies classes on the Standing Rock res school.He ignores the fact that first impressions are deceiving and has to backtrack to make things right with her after the way he treats her. Fortune smiles on him when she accidentally locks her keys in her car (along with everything she has) and he volunteers up a room at his Mother's house for her.They are studies in opposites. Azreal was once a famous Hollywood actor that walked away from everything to head back to his roots and Cheyenne grew up trying her hardest to create lifelong roots in the Native American culture of her step-father.The big question is - is all this sizzle and electricity between them just something that is a fling or can they make it something deeper and more meaningful? Can her dream man from her childhood be Azreal or are they just the dreams of a young girl? Is Cheyenne really the woman he has been trying to find and hang on to his whole life?This book was refreshing to sit and just read.  I didn't have to try and get into a characters head or deal with incredibly overused sentences and phrases.

1890,1890,"""I'm a selfish prick, and I want to be the greatest f~  k of your life and ruin you for every man who comes after me. But I'm not a mind reader, so I need some help.""This novella starts off as a story about rough sex and role play between two consenting adults who met by chance. But story grows into following the friendship that ensues and sweet budding romance.Hero: Michael Flynn, ""Flynn""/32 years/construction worker-underground fighter/dark hair/hazel-blue eyes/6'3""Heroine: Laurel White/29 years/unemployed engineer-waitress/colored red hairWhile the hero, Flynn has been in tune with this rougher side of himself since his mid-twenties, the heroine, Laurel has not. Their first encounter takes place when Flynn breaks up a domestic argument with Laurel sitting nearby.She is quite taken with him and boldly pursues him. I might have preferred the hero to pursue the heroine, but as the story unfolds we learn about Laurel's struggles both personal and professional in recent years.  She is in need of a change.  I'd like to think that it was her inner sub who felt a connection to Flynn. In addition to being impressed with his looks and his size she probably sensed his dominance and was drawn to him.  I found Laurel both genuine and endearing.  Nevertheless their first couple of encounters offers some good quotes much thanks to Flynn's sharp tongue:""Yes, I'm asking you out then."" [Laurel]""Sorry, but I'll take a pass."" [Flynn]***""Hey,"" she said.""Hey yourself, sub shop girl. Took me a minute to remember why I recognized you.""I really enjoyed Flynn. He also feels real and genuine, a regular guy with a regular job. Raised by his sister who describes him:""Sober, employed, no record.""He works out at the gym every night after work and does underground fighting on the weekends. He engages in non-committal sex and role play. Though he can enjoy traditional sex he prefers rougher sex.His comes across as elusive and he is bossy with that sharp tongue of his. I hereby crown Flynn the King of come-backs!  He speaks his mind and doesn't hold back:""And I'll tell you now, I won't be calling you tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, so don't get in a stink when I don't. None of the normal dating rules apply to this.""***""Well, draw yourself a pretty little blueprint and do me a favor and don't show it to me. I like fighting, and I like f~ ing. I don't care much for thinking.""But he is also very caring and kind. He is very unassuming in his interactions and his approach to life in general.  An all-around great guy!Flynn is the attraction of the story.  Laurel was sweet and endearing the more I got to know her, but she did not leave as much of an impression. Part of that I attribute to her submissive personality and the story being a novella. But the biggest part for me is always - the larger the hero the more the heroine tends to fade into the background.The sex was hot and intense!, Flynn has quite a command and though the role play delivered I found myself really enjoying when the softer side of Flynn came out.I would highly recommend Flynn's and Laurel's story.

1891,1891,"The title and blurb may turn people off and perhaps scare people off.  But I do think the title and the blurb are misleading.  I will tell you what this book is not - it is not a BDSM book.  There are not rape scenes and there is no violent love scenes.  What there  is (amazingly) is very good character development, a slow building relationship, and some  hot love scenes that push the boundaries of  some people's comfort level.  In a very yummy and steamy way.The story is told from the point of view of Laurel.  She is bored with life and sort of stuck.  She is no longer pursuing a career in her field of study and she is not sure what she wants out of life.  Laurel meets Flynn and pursues him for a date.  What follows is Laurel being the aggressor in setting up a date and time to be alone with Flynn.  The pursuit was slightly uncomfortable because I kept imagining myself chasing down a hot guy in a park and asking him for date - I couldn't wrap my brain around it.  But Cara McKenna is good at pushing those boundaries for her readers.  In the end, Flynn makes Laurel push hard to convince him that they should get together.  Most girls would give up - -I definitely would.  But Laurel doesn't and admittedly, it feels odd.  Not because it is written poorly - just the opposite.  McKenna writes the scene well, but it feels odd for the female to keep insisting on a date!  Flynn is a construction worker by day and an underground street fighter by night.  Once the story takes off, the roles are turned and Laurel is no longer the aggressor.  We soon learn why Flynn made it so difficult for Laurel, Flynn makes it clear what he needs and wants from a physical relationship  --  complete submission from his partner.  He doesn't want to tie her up, he doesn't want to beat her or hurt her but he wants her to submit in a physical relationship. But he tells her upfront and gives her a chance to walk away.  Laurel doesn't walk away.What follows are some very hot loves scenes.  Flynn is physically huge and dominating physically, but he is a big sweetheart and very sensitive in everyday interactions.  Slowly, Flynn and Laurel get to know each other.  What McKenna writes so well in her erotica novellas, is the unraveling of the male character and his complete surrender to his partner.  We are introduced to a strong male, completely in charge - -but in the end, he becomes completely undone by Laurel and that is the hottest thing in this book.  I would have loved for this book to be longer and I would love for Cara McKenna to revisit these characters.I am not a fan of BDSM books nor am I a fan of rape fantasies - this is not what Willing Victim is about.

She somehow decides to trust him, lets him, and they try to have sex.This occurs a few times. They try to have sex, and they try, and they try. Then, about halfway through the book it emerges that Mitch can't have sex with her because if he does, she'll be Lucifer's slave.Yeah.Oh, and Tina has been psychic all along, which is fine.

Not even close to the level I have seen in many other books, but still enough to detract from an otherwise fantastic book.I bought this because I loved the concept of the open house and even more, the concept of our home being the keeper of our secrets.

Next comes some delicious and literally earth moving kitchen lovin', the beginning of a zombie apocalypse and that's just the first chapter!From the start I loved the chemistry between Griff and Jemma. The comradeship of having been best friends for ten years was evident and the tangible sexual tension between the two was electric. I was rooting for them as a couple. And if I had any doubts of Jemma as a heroine they were wiped away when she tried to take down a zombie using a ThighBlaster.The secondary cast of Clarissa (the coven leader) and the other witches (Mrs Peach, Gloria) were delightful. I loved the banter and pop culture references they delivered.And Logan Scott? '[He's] the guy your mamma warned you about. 'The ultimate biker boy complete with the mirrored shades, barbed wire tattoo and snug jeans - I loved him. Normally I don't like any character that threatens the Happily Ever After that I desire but I loved what Logan brought to the story. The fact that he brought out Griff's jealous side... that is just a bonus!After finishing the book, I'm still a little unsure as to why the m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois strengthened Jemma's magic but it was such an hot and steamy scene that I'll let it slide. I really enjoyed the creativeness of the sex scenes. And the humour that was present throughout everything.The witch/zombie/shifter storyline was exciting too - this book, whilst mostly is about the romance and the sex also has more too it - and it kept me guessing. I loved how Jemma grew as a character. She became the kick-ass heroine that her witchy ancestors (well... most of them) would be proud of.This is probably the funniest erotic romance that I've ever read. I am so excited about the next book in the series (which is out and I have already bought!) being about Clarissa and Logan.

They also find the area educators to be less than cooperative when it comes to boy blaming him and his family for any issues related to his education.  When a beaten body is found in the local cemetery, rumors run rampant that it is the missing boy and Cinnamon vows to get to the bottom of what is really going on in this small northern border town.Tower Lowe's, In Dulce, Disturbed, is a short story, but you would never know it by the depths of Lowe's characters.

1916,1916,"I just finished reading ""One Insular Tahiti"" by Thea Atkinson, and would like to say a few words about it. I don't think I can really do this work justice, but was impressed enough to give it a go.This is not a beach read. This is not a fun read. This is the real deal.From the beginning, the author pulls you into the story with imagery that flows from surreal serenity to a hard slap up side the head. From the bobbing in the ocean... to the unknown stains on the frat house floor... to the vomit on the borrowed shoes... the descriptions are almost poetic, then suddenly so stark and real that you can smell the scene.The main characters are genuine, not super-human imaginings that can do no wrong. They're scarred by life and full of the foibles that make people human, yet still struggling to maintain the course toward the right thing to do. And at the end, you almost understand.Then there are the pieces strewn here and there... little things that appear to be random thoughts that spilled from the author's bit bucket. Gradually you realize that these aren't just accidental droppings, that they're brush-strokes, that the author is painting a picture on the canvas of your subconscious. It isn't a smiling, happy picture, but it's beautiful in its reality. It's a picture of humanity in turmoil, dragged from the One Insular Tahiti into a world of doubt and pain and fulfillment. It's a picture of purple grass that grows by the side of the ocean.Though I could easily enough, I won't ramble on any more.Reading ""One Insular Tahiti"" was a painful pleasure that I just had to say something about.",1,1,0.585889571,0.585889571,NY

Ergo, I will buy more of his books, so I'm glad I was given the opportunity to read this.I probably would have given it four stars, but after reading all the unsubstantiated poor reviews, I decided to throw in an extra star for good measure. I do feel the price is high for a novella. Even with the percentage difference from KDP, if you sell 2000 books at 99 cents as opposed to 100 at $2.99, you'll come out ahead and avoid the pitfalls of people giving bad reviews for pricing.A delightful and easy read.

That's expounded on in this novel.  JR Rain is good at making his main characters very flawed which makes for more interesting reading.  He also reads very real.  He's shy because he's suffered a great loss in life but he's a good PI who's not afraid to throw a few punches when necessary.  As an aside, Spinoza is almost the polar opposite of Knighthorse--the anti Knighthorse if you will.  He's older, a little out of shape and painfully shy.  But they're both good at their jobs and they both seem to like their booze..a little bit too much apparently.Spinoza's past also dictates the type of business he runs: Spinoza specializes in the disappeared, especially lost children.  It's for that reason that, when a kindly old woman comes into his office looking to hire him to find her lost adopted granddaughter, Spinoza can't say no.  There's a twist though.  Veronica, the teenager he's to be looking for, claims to be a vampire slayer.  Is she off her rocker?  Or is Spinoza about ready to see a side of the world he never could have imagined existed?This is a fun and fast paced read.  There's just enough background given on Spinoza where it doesn't bog the story down but the reader will feel as if they know where he's coming from, what his motivations are.  As always in a JR Rain novel the dialogue is fast and witty as well.  That's always a staple of Rain's novels.  Even the supporting cast, no matter how small their part, read well, each having their own personality and mannerisms.  That's no small feat for a character that comes and goes in only a couple pages.The book is short but it's priced accordingly.  So if you're already a fan of JR Rain's Samantha Moon and Jim Knighthorse series you'd do well to check this out.",1,1,0.616972477,0.9042431190000001,NY
1924,1924,"I absolutely loved this books of course I love anything to do with Vampires. J.R. Rain has done it again with this book. His style of writing detailing the people in the book so you can close your eyes and picture them like you are right there watching everything unfold. The humor and wit he puts into his characters is awesome. I even like how he mentions characters from another book really great.This is a great story a Private Investigator in search for a womans adopted granddaughter who has been missing longer than normal for her. The twist the girl believes she is a true vampire slayer. Veronica as she is known was on the hunt for one particular man ""vampire"" believed to have killed her parents and Spinoza was going to find her come hell or high water. He was the best in the business and that was why Detective Hammond of the LAPD refered the grandmother to him.I enjoyed how during the search for Veronica you learn about Spinoza's life, the trials he has gone through to get him where he is now. The loss of his wife and son the alcohol issues and the reoccuring nightmares he has. He shares this with his buddy Detective Hammond and his girlfriend so its really great really brings you into the story more.I just have really fallen for J.R. Rains style of writing and just downloaded 6 more books of his. Great job.",1,1,0.55,0.64,NY

This is another of Mira Kolar Brown's complex mysteries that is a joy to read, although it is not an easy task because of the complexities of the plot and the many diverse characters she introduces. I usually whip through a book in 2-3 days, but not this one. It took me over a week to read because I had to reread sections to keep the story straight in my head and to truly appreciate her many interesting characters.Inspector Simon Grant is a complex man who is very moral and forthright on some fronts, but not in others. He is involved in an adulterous relationship with his wife Pippa's sister whom he has impregnated. Very spicy stuff.Ms. Kolar Brown deftly deals with many issues in this novel, not to mention a double serial killing of two young women.

1942,1942,"Ok... here's the thing.  I'm going to do my best not to include any spoilers, but I'm definitely going to be referencing some stuff that happens later in the book because I could see where things were headed by the time I was halfway through the book.For the first third of the book we have this AWESOME chemistry between Rori and Jude and then I get to cheer for her because she refuses to be treated like a piece of meat, the way Jude normally treats his women.  Seriously, what's with these other chicks that they're totally okay jumping him that afternoon and then seeing him out on a date with Rori that evening and then go so far as to proposition him in front of her?  Although at least that gave Rori the heads up that no matter how hot Jude is in bed, she deserves a better MAN outside of it.Enter Zach... hurrah!  Rori's biggest sexy time connection with Jude was that she discovered she's submissive and she was really turned on by his dominant side.  Zach is yet another sexy dominant who is smitten with Rori, but Zach has no problem being an amazing, romancing relationship guy.  I totally started to fall for him and then I remembered that this book is called ""Second Chances"" and that the blurb mostly talks about Jude.At which point I start going oh eff no, because Zach is too possessive for this to be a sharing book.Suffice to say, figuring out halfway through the book exactly how Jude was going to be positioned to get a second chance, and then having his second chance with Rori being RUSHED through the last third of the book, I did not come away satisfied.  There's not enough time spent on Jude's reformation and there's not enough connection between him and Rori to satisfy me.  I felt the strongest connection with Zach and yet we already know before reading that that relationship isn't ultimately going anywhere, which makes it really hard to get invested in it.By the time I got to the last third of the book I was really emotionally detached from everything that was going on because I couldn't connect with Zach anymore and I didn't want to connect again with Jude, who had been such an a$$ throughout 2/3 of the book.Dane's written much better stuff.

Not exactly unforgettable, but it does make an impression that might leave you feeling a little chillier when you've closed the book - because it is a chilling tale.The writing is mostly bare-bones, little detail goes into characterization or descriptors, and since it is a short story, that's quite alright. I'd have liked to know more about the main character though - he had a vague, sort of Everyman quality that made him serviceable as a plot device, but not terribly interesting. Conversely, Coghlan's description of environment is beautiful, from the sunlit lookout to the grey, dreary town, this author certainly knows how to set a scene.The author claims this book is ""free forever"", so what've you got to lose but a few minutes of your time?

With some life threatening danger added in to the mix with the mind altering sex neither is prepared for the outcome that occurred.Visit us at Fairytales4grownups.com for the full review and everything Romance Novels like many more reviews and our blog.",1,1,0.545454545,1.0,CA

1965,1965,"Jennifer Saints cobbled together a series of sex scenes and called it a romantic mystery.Thirty minutes before her wedding, the heroine is given a set of pictures showing her groom-to-be engaging in sex with a group of women.  Naturally, she calls the wedding off, and as she is fleeing the scene, still wearing her wedding dress, who should appear but her teenage crush.  She hasn't seen him for twelve years, but he whisks her away, and they proceed to have sex as often as possible, preferably nude and outdoors on the deck of the hero's beach house.  It goes without saying that every time they have sex, it's better than the last time.  Unfortunately, there's nothing there that we haven't read before, dozens of times, and that scene with the melted chocolate has been done so many times it was embarrassing to read it again.The book could also do with a good copy editor.  It's riddled with mistakes like ""daring-do"" for ""derring-do"", ""me and you"" instead of ""you and I"", and the hero wanting the heroine ""bad"" not badly.  They are a real distraction from what little plot there is.Ms. Saints has done her homework, and manages to include almost all of the cliches for this genre.  The heroine's family is rich and evil.  The hero's is poor and good.  His mother is a Wise Woman who rules her family of wild men with the iron hand in the velvet glove.  Unfortunately, she has a lot of children, so this series can run on for a long time.Evidently, the paperback edition has some photographs in it that are supposed to enhance the story (such as it is).  They aren't in the Kindle Fire version, so I can't say anything about them.I got this book as a freebie, and it was over-priced.

I then immediately purchased Book 2 of this series (Smooth Irish), which features Jesse's older brother, Jackson. As far as this book goes, Jesse and Alexi have such a great dynamic together. I love the fact that the author immediately clarifies the misunderstanding between these two once they are reunited as opposed to other authors who will drag you along for the entire plot and then the characters realize they could have saved themselves a lot of heartache if only they had sat down and talked. Grrrrrrr!!! Alexi is a very practical heroine and it is impossible not to love her. Jesse is the typical guy who doesn't believe in love until he almost loses his woman.

Both Alexi and Roger's families are rich pillars of society. With only an hour left before the wedding a parcel arrives, with an accompanying message, ""the family jewels"". Inside were pictures of Roger at his batchelor party, he is naked with more than one prostitute. Furious Alexi confronts Roger, whose only excuse is that it meant nothing. Alexi is outraged and calls the wedding off. The press were in attendance at the wedding, as this was the merging of the two leading families of the area, and now they were in hot pursuit of Alexi. Whilst making her escape she trips only to be saved from hitting the ground by Jesse Weldon, the man Alexi fell in love with twelve years ago. A man whom she had never been able to erase from her memory.This is a fast paced story, the writers style is punchy and witty. The characters are well depicted and likeable. The sexual chemistry between the H/h is really hot. The plot really gets interesting after Alexi cancels the wedding, as Alexi comes under threat from an anonymous source. Which means Jesse has to step in to save her. Plenty of twists and turns keep the story flowing and interesting.

Caught in the aftermath is Jesse, a ""bad boy from the wrong side of town"" with whom Alexi once had a fling with. In the midst of mystery, the two find romance.WILD IRISH was a bit different than what I was expecting. It contained a mystery that was full of intrigue though it seemed painfully obvious (to me) who the culprit was. The majority of the novel dealt with Alexi's self-discovery and Jesse's need to prove himself to the town. Those three elements would have made a fantastic story but the novel was weighed down by what I believed to be too much cliche sex. It just felt like author Jennifer Saints felt the need to throw in sex to get people interested and it cause some scenes to lose significance.Another problem I had were the few editing issues I found. It's not enough to be annoying, per say, but a few misplaced commas caught my attention, as well as some incorrect tenses of a verb.I wanted to rate this at least a 3 for its execution of an interesting storyline but the erotica portions were just too odd at some points that I felt the need to lower the ranking.

She asks him to take her away and he can't resist being her savior once again. Jesse and Alexi attempt to outrun the paparazzi and rekindle the heat between them along the way. Can they make a relationship work this time? Or will she always be a blue-blood and Jesse, the boy from the wrong side of the tracks?Wild Irish is a sizzling, sexy love story. Alexi and Jesse have fiery chemistry that heats the pages. Their first kiss after being apart twelve years is combustible. It is so easy to fall in love with these characters and the fabulous story that brings them together.

She is also a very passionate person.  Jackson and Nan dated for a little while until she realized that there was no future for them.  At that point Nan walked away and went on with her life.  Well, that didn't sit well with Jackson and he wasn't going to just sit back and let that happen.Months after their break up, neither Nan nor Jackson could really forget the other.

She has even begun to dream about him and write in her journal about the fantasies she has in which he is the star.  With these dreams and the knowledge that Jackson was only interested in her for a short time Nan doesn't know what to do, especially when he unknowingly reveals more and more about himself to her.  Jackson doesn't want to be committed or responsible for anything but can't seem to get Nan out of his system.  Without realizing what is happening the more time he spends with her the more he is revealing about himself, stuff he never wants anyone to know.

1987,1987,"This mystery is firmly plotted along the lines of the innumerable Post-Feminist Lady in Distress sub-genre. It has the young woman amateur sleuth, the ""hot"" guy whom she wants to bed, the police guy who wants to bed her and who has his appeal for her, the best friend, the exploration of her needs, & etc., etc. What this book has, that so many of its sisters do not have, is a skilled writer who knows how to put words and sentences down on paper (figuratively speaking) and knows how to give her characters life within the narrow confines of what must be a relatively short and easily accessible novel. I was initially concerned at her including in her heroines personality, a truly terrible disease, what was until very recently called manic depressive behavior, now termed bipolar disorder; however, as the book progressed, she handled it well. There are some weaknesses to be mentioned: she shares the common deficiency of most writers in the sub-genre of failing firmly to embed her heroines crime solutions in available facts logically organized, there is an undue emphasis on happy or unhappy chance events, some of the characters are straw-""persons"", etc. None of these characteristics weighed much against the book on my scale of pleasure.

1988,1988,"The illustrations in this book are complex, eye catching, filled with detail, and beautiful.The story is about Mallika a young tigress who has a problem settling down and handling her frustration.  One day Babur, Mallika's mother, is teaching Mallika and her brother, Ben,  to hunt.  The brother causes Mallika to lose a peacock.  As Mallika tries to calm down she takes a walk and ends up falling into some ruins.  How she manages to escape and control her frustration is the heartwarming finish.Here is my issue, I can see this book on handling frustration, but I don't see unrighteous anger.  Mallika doesn't get angry over silly little things, that normal kids would become angry for.  She doesn't have temper tantrums.  She immediately listens to and obeys her mother. The couple of times she does get angry are due to her brother losing her catch, and the monkeys teasing her about it.What I see is a story of perseverance but not anger management.  So while I see, with a little story editing, a fantastic story on control.  I do not see the ""anger management"", as discussed not only in the title, but several times in the book.  In fact, the numerous mentions of Mallika being mad forced me out of the story.  It would have been better to ""show"" her anger through her deeds.So with that, I highly recommend this book.

High class or low class, women were expected to dressed up which could take hours depending on how high class your family was.  To the point that after every thing was done, you still didn't  have any underwear on or if you did you had to have a servant or two to pull it down so you could use the chamberpot then get you clean and get all the pettycoats all back in place. And only the very rich had stools for the women to sit on so the pettycoats would fall to the floor around the women or they were left to stand until the next day.  As sitting in a normal chair allowed all that passed to see all those pettycoats as well if were wearing underwear or not.

1991,1991,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""The Reluctant Detective"" by Sinclair Mcleod (@sinclairmacleod), the first book in a series featuring private investigator Craig Campbell.I've made no secret in the past of my love for British mysteries available to us Yanks by PBS or on DVD, and this book is very much in that tradition. There are great characters, plot twists and red herrings, smart dialogue and a wonderful setting that compliments the story.The book starts with a woman approaching Campbell to ask for his help in determining her son's death was not the accident it was labeled by the police. Campbell is an insurance investigator, meaning his workload is debunking and occasionally confirming the validity of claims, but he agrees to help the grieving mother. If nothing else, he reasons, he'll set her mind to rest by confirming the events as true and returning the money advanced to him.But even a cursory glance at the facts makes Campbell uneasy: the dead son was a confirmed teetotaler, but was found with alcohol in his system. A police officer friend looks at the case and agrees the decision may have been hasty. And things really begin to crackle as Campbell delves into the dead man's workplace.As always, no spoilers from me, but the plot moves along at a good pace and there are a few well-conceived twists along the way, including a great one at the end, to keep the reader on his or her toes. The setting is wintertime Glasgow, Scotland, which makes a fine backdrop for the action, and Mcleod gives the reader a guided tour of the city and its population.Although ""The Reluctant Detective"" stands well enough on its own, I'm pleased to see Mr. Mcleod has followed up with two more mysteries featuring Craig Campbell. My To-Read List grows again as I'm adding them post-haste. I highly recommend ""The Reluctant Detective"" to anyone looking for a good mystery with interesting characters and a great location.",1,1,0.63760218,0.8792007270000001,CA

Because of my enjoyment of that series I decided to read another one of C.L. Bevill's works.BIG MISTAKEIt is honestly hard to believe that these books were written by the same author.  Where the Bubba books move effortlessly through the plot, 'Dial M for Mascara' is a disjointed, tiresome series of idiotic dialogue and soft core porn.The endless nattering between the characters, especially between Mary Grace and her best friend is so idiotic and 'Shecky Greene' like that it becomes exhausting from the very start.It is supposed to be a comedic mystery, but the level of insipid disregard for the danger the title character is in makes it anything but funny.Many of the characters are clownish and one often wonders what purpose they serve in the story.I ended up deleting this from my Kindle at 70%.  I tried to hang on in an effort to discover who was trying to kill Mary Grace and why, but at that point I realized that probably everybody had a vested interest in snuffing out this airheaded, big boobed, shopping addicted, waste of flesh and I honestly couldn't have cared less who actually attempted it as long as they were successful.I think from now on I will stick strictly to the 'Bubba' books.",1,0,0.600760456,-0.066539924,CA

2004,2004,"The first six or seven reviews for this author/series read like what you'd expect from a 6th grade class required to turn in book reports. Set next to classic dragon stories - McCaffrey, Weis, Yolen to name just a few - it's laughably poor writing and structure. The characters are flat, the plot passive, and the ""series"" isn't worthy of the title. Reads like a first effort that should have been set aside as a practice piece, while the author went on to better things.

2006,2006,"Crimzon & Clover I - Orphaned Dragon, Lucky Girl by M. R. Mathias is an enchanting read. It is the first in a series of short stories that include Crimzon & Clover II - The Tricky Wizard, Crimzon & Clover III - The Grog, and Crimzon & Clover IV - The Wrath of Crimzon. Crimzathrion is an orphaned dragon, his mother and sibling were killed by men in the nest. It took her two days to die as she used her energy to cast a spell on her musical words that would come back regularly to guide the young dragon. At four days of age it appeared he was alone. Not quite. Clover, a young woman, ended up discovering him by following the crying noise. She understood how vulnerable he was at that time. While keeping a distance, she would leave food where he would find it, asking nothing in return. When the dragon seemed strong enough, Clover made plans to leave the next day. Before that could happen, Crimzathrion confronted her to express his appreciation. He presented her with the biggest treasure, his mother&#8217;s crystallized tear that contained an enormous amount of magic. The story continues in an adventure of Clover going for a flight on the dragon&#8217;s back and fighting men that have come to hurt them. I love this story! It is so well-written and entertaining to read. I will definitely read the entire series to find out what happens next. Would highly recommend, 5 stars!",1,1,0.6909722220000001,1.0,CA

This Kindle e-book was a 168 Kb download (approx. 51 printed pages) and was free (normally $1.00) at the time of righting this review.This tale took up approximately 41%  of the download, the remainder was excerpts of other books by the same author.&lt;spoilers>This tale tells of a hatchling dragon, Crimzon, (whose mother has be killed) and an adventurer, Clover, who discovers the abandoned creature and provides him not only with sustenance but also a budding friendship. As they develop their relationship they encounter a group of treasure hunters who are hell bent and determined to discover the fabled dragon's lair.&lt;end spoiler>Some thoughts on ""Crimzon and Clover""...1.) an adventure that many might consider in the Young Adult (YA) genre. Regardless, I really enjoyed this short work as it was generally well written and exciting... it just didn't have the same depth and diversity that fantasy readers might expect to find in a full length adult fantasy adventure.2.) intriguing, eye-catching cover.3.) Crimzon's hissing dialect had many words ending with 'esses'.... an annoying  characteristic that you'd probably find in a YA tale as opposed to an adult fantasy story. I couldn't imagine this speech pattern for a full length novel.Conclusion:A fun fantasy adventure featuring a young dragon and a female adventurer. Short, well written and interesting. Just long enough.3 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com",1,1,0.71147541,0.762391514,CA
2008,2008,"Bored out of my mind on a train to Los Angeles I had my trusty Kindle. So, I glanced through the TBR list, found Timelapse, and thought why not. Well surprise, surprise within a few pages I was sucked into an alternate universe where nothing made sense.It was as if I was living the experience with Alex the story&#8217;s hero and main squeeze. His sideline story added a human touch to him. Usually I&#8217;m not a back story gal; I have an issue with patience. So I&#8217;m generally like &#8216;let&#8217;s just get this story on the road, like now&#8217;. In this case however, that dimension of Alex would not have been as clear without the back story. My perception of him would have been less empathetic. His occasional whine based victim behavior would have annoyed me. Because, I knew back story, I was able to just write it off to being a man.I don&#8217;t like reviews that screw up reading surprises. I&#8217;m going to try and do this with no spoilers. First off, I love books that are well edited and well written. This book takes care of both of those, must have needs.My second big buggy boo is under developed characters that are flat. Whose voices you can&#8217;t hear clearly when reading the dialogue. Well this book got a check and check on both. Are these people your standard run of the mill romance characters? No, but that is not a bad thing in this case. They are off beat and more than a little kooky but very likeable and easy to read.The storyline was good, that said I&#8217;m not a big Sci Fi fan. This strikes me as a bit more Steampunk then Sci Fi and I love, love, love Steampunk. Because the author didn&#8217;t forget, this was a romance too. The end result, this is, a fun little kicky story. Sort of Brave New World meets Walden Pond with a little Harry Orwell thrown in for interest and intrigue. The female character Jessie is not you&#8217;re &#8216;heaving bosom in the bracken romance girl.&#8217; She is part chick lit, part Steam Punk and part romance heroine.She has grit and determination and Jessie is tough, I think of her as a stone covered marshmallow. In my opinion, this is what makes her easy to forgive. I did like her don&#8217;t get me wrong although I admit. On occasion, I wanted to shake her then tell her to get it together. I happen to have several friends who bring out that same reaction in me.Overall I have to give a five star folks, it&#8217;s a read and a half, so enjoy. Time wise I read this book during a four hour round trip train ride. While enjoying two very good Bloody Marys.",1,1,0.659898477,0.721735118,CA
2009,2009,"In Time Lapse, by Lorrie Farrelly, Alex Morgan lost his wife Casey and gained his son Jack. After continuing his studies in Washington, D.C., Alex is a popular assistant professor, tucked away in the tiny office of an information technology professor on sabbatical.After Alex finds a strange device in the office, he is catapulted into an alternate universe. People live under the autocratic weight of the ruling regime, with pockets of freedom fighters defying their oppressors&#8230; and paying the price of brutal death.Lost in a world eerily similar to his own, yet radically different with the loss of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, Alex meets Jessie, a freedom fighter. As he tries to find his way through the landmines of the strange world with Jessie&#8217;s help, Alex discovers the insane plot of a megalomaniac.Will Alex and Jessie be in time to save the world?This well-written and plotted book, with its believable characters, is an excellent science fiction novel with a wonderful love story.

2010,2010,"I can think of absolutely no reason for anyone to be able to give this novel anything other than 5 stars! From the first page the story captivated me and held my interest until the final page.This is a love story, a very human story, as well as being a sci-fi about time travel. But it was the human interest side which gripped me most.The main character Alex is totally lovable. He is very real as he grieves for his dead wife, retaining the will to live only for the sake of their young son, Jack.When Alex accidently finds a time travel device, which is very much like a mobile phone and I could quite imagine these things becoming a reality, he travels to a world which is unrecognisable from his own.Alex has travelled to an America which is run like something out of 1984 by George Orwell. Citizens live under a strict regime and fear for their lives. Here Alex meets Jessie who is one of the brave fighting for their right to freedom. Of course they fall in love and by a sheer fluke they travel back in time to the attempted assassination of a previous American president. Alex is able to thwart the attempt which was organised by the owner of the time travel device who had sought to create a utopia.Instead, when he learns of the world he created for the likes of people like Jessie, he gives up his device and Jessie and Alex are able to travel back to the present together.I don't wish this review to do an injustice to this story. It is not just a love story but so much more. There is plenty of action and danger for Alex and Jessie but the author does not try to bombard the reader with complex explanations behind the theory of time travel.You have to read this book!

2011,2011,"Timelapse only got up to two stars because I think the author does a pretty good job of creating his alternative world. However, his main character, Alex, was totally unbelievable. As opposed to another reviewer who like him and was rooting for him, I was praying for him to be shot dead. I forced myself to finish the book so that I wouldn't write a bad review in case it had a great ending.Alex is supposed to be a fairly intelligent assistant professor at a university. Now I can understand when the transformation first occcurs how one might be in shock and possibly do some stupid things. But his stupidity never ended. He quickly surmised that the world was very different and very bloodthirsty, but every time he found something different he started to act up in so as to draw attention to himself and his companion, thus endangering their lives. He can't find all of his relatives in the registry, so he acts up in public. He discovers there are no libraries, so he goes running off in a huge distressed huff. For some reason he was totally surprised when his money was no good, even though he knew this world was dramatically different from his own. On and on - he was shocked when anything was different from his world. No one, and especially not a well educated history professor, is that stupid, over and over and over again.

2017,2017,"This book had great potential. The writer seemed to point out a lot of legitimate problems with IR relationships. What went wrong with the book is it had too many issues. First, the lead lady Shauna was a woman who just could not make up her friggin' mind about whether she was ashamed of being seen with Miles or not. And when they argued about it, never really set the issue straight as to where it wouldn't be thrown in her face again. Second, there so much negativity the relationship between Miles and Shauna could go no where but down. Shauna and Miles were constantly at war with each other except when it came to sex and that had been her main issue all along. If the two couldn't make it a week without verbally sparring, then why be together? And his off the side, eager Rita -- personally that character had me applauding only because she didn't care about anything but getting laid. IMO Miles was more reasonable than Shauna, who the reader is lead to believe is the more practical one. I felt there were too many details on the innerworkings of cable companies, too much on the white/black issue that wasn't resolved between the couple, too much sex and bickering over indecisiveness along with a lack of development between Miles getting to know her daughter, Shauna dealing with finalizing her relationship with Mr. I'm-Too-Sexy-For-Myself Clarance and Celeste, who wasn't supportive despite how the writer seemed to state otherwise. If I brought a man to meet a friend and she went off on him like Celeste did, no matter what color he was, she would have been on my bad side for a very long time. And the ending was done poorly. Why stop with Miles being attacked by dogs, Shauna searching and not finding him until reaching home where he's sitting on the stoop waiting for her at which point everything is sunshine and lemonade between the two, the end.

Alma still sleeps with his mistress while wanting Diana and only stops when he realizes another man might ask to marry Diana and he decides that he wants to marry her too.

2034,2034,"First of all let me say that I read the 1 star review, and I almost did not buy this book.  Boy, am I glad that I ignored that review!  This book is amazing.  It is very well written, with an interesting plot, and wonderful characters.  Alma and Diana's relationship gets off to a rocky start when she shoots him in the butt with an arrow before they've even been introduced to each other!  Matters are made totally worst when Diana is called upon to ""surgically"" remove the arrow.  Alma is completely mortified by this situation.  In those days gently reared young ladies did not see a gentleman unclothed and Alma was very aware of and abided by society's rules.  At first he is very uncomfortable around Diana and his mood is made that much worst by the fact that he is unable to sit and cannot participate in his favorite activities of riding and driving.  He does fluctuate between being miserable and nice.  According to all the other characters in the book, Alma is normally a very pleasant, easy going sort of fellow so his churlish behaviour towards the heroine is very unusual.  George, Diana's brother and friend of Alma's, has to leave for London and the h is left to entertain the Hero as best she can.  Don't worry a lady is brought in from the village to play chaperone so all the proprieties are observed.  Over the next two weeks the relationship between the two develop and by the time Alma returns to London they are in love with each other, neither is aware of his/her love for the other.  Accordingly, Alma returns to London and his previous life, including his mistress.  The h and H meet again in London when Diana makes an unexpected trip to the city and so their relationship continues to flourish.  It is not until close to the end of the book that they each figure out how they feel about the other.  As soon as Alma becomes aware of his feelings for Diana he immediately discontinues his relationship with his mistress.....even though at that time he has no idea whether or not his suit for Diana will be accepted.  Yes, the introduction of one of Diana's past admirers does help to prompt Alma to become aware of his feelings, but that is nothing unusual. I could go on and on about this book, but as this is only a review and not a discussion I shall say no more.  I do agree that for such a lighthearted read this book dealt with some heavy issues, specifically the question of whether young ladies of quality did experience sexual desire was raised.  Oh, the romance of George (Diana's brother) and his lady love, Alonna is also followed throughout the book.  I absolutely loved George and Alonna!  They were two lovely characters.

2036,2036,"Lady Caroline Waverly decided as a child that societal rules restricting women to beautiful objects were idiotic and that SHE wasn't going to follow them. Having no parents to influence her otherwise, and blessed with a fortune and a prosperous estate, she could indulge her passion for scholarship and estate management without worrying over much about being condemned as a bluestocking.As a child of 12, she'd inadvertently caught her beautiful cousin Lavinia laughing at a handsome young man's marriage proposal. When the devastated young man caught her eavesdropping, she told him candidly that her cousin was beautiful and charming, but also quite self-centered, and that she cared for no person as much as herself. And although Nicholas Daventry was wealthy and from an aristocratic family, he was a second son and thus quite beneath the touch of a jewel like Lavinia.Realizing it was true, Nicholas went off to war, distinguished himself in battle, and six years later, returned to London as a marquess, after the deaths of his father and older brother. In the meantime, Lavinia, now the Countess of Welham, has been widowed, and the intervening years have given her a mature beauty that once again draws Nicholas to her. He should know better--and he is well aware of the fact that he should--but she draws him like no other, and he is hopeful that marriage and motherhood have matured her in more than just outward appearance.Of course, Caroline looks on with derision, recalling their conversation on the stairs six years ago, and seeing that even a man such as this is putty in the hands of a lovely woman. Nicholas's impression of the grown-up Caroline changes considerably as they become acquainted. At first she's a nonentity and he feels sorry for her being so much less attractive than her cousin. Then he begins to see how she lights up the lives of everyone around her and really has no need to put herself forward in society. The more he sees her--and compares her character with her cousin's--he finds himself wanting to be in her company. And the more he is with her, the more attractive she becomes. (And she's never been unattractive either.)But Nicholas is a man, and his eyes still light up when he sees the ephemeral beauty of Lavinia. And frankly, they are still lighting up around the vampy Lavinia through 75% of the book, even though he is well on his way to falling for Caroline. This bothered me a LOT. As much as he agrees with Caroline that society is shallow, he still holds up Lavinia as a jewel of the ton. Although as time passes he realizes that a beautiful self-serving fribble is not for him, he takes far too long to realize that Caroline IS.How I wish Ms. Richardson had thought to include a scene of Lavinia's chagrin upon discovering she has lost her prey to her bluestocking cousin. Oh, I feel like I deserved that!",1,1,0.567084079,1.0,CA

I am a sucker for these types of stories... someone goes through hell, or has a tormented past and has someone or meets someone to help them overcome... ending in love! But I found this book making me angry, I found the characters unbelievable, mainly on how they talked and how their conversations went. I think someone else commented on that also, which almost made me not give this book a chance... but I did anyway. I think another thing that made me angry was, I am *****POSSIBLE SPOILER****** not a fan of D/s and that's where it all led too and for it to be used to help overcome someones hell of being kidnapped and tortured... sexually and mentally... yeah, didn't set to well with me. And if I read or hear someone refer to someone else as 'my boy' I think I will lose my lunch... really? Does anyone really say that? The term was slightly over used. I so wanted to like this book, but I am sad to say I didn't, sure it kept me reading, to find out what would happen, but when I realized it was headed to where I was hoping it wouldn't... it just left me disappointed.",1,0,0.6259842520000001,0.187007874,CA

Paul can be described as a adult who enjoys playing with trains and doesn't really have a good idea of what ""Feeling of being in love"" is. He knows he is attracted to Bette but has some childlike behavior ways of showing it. Acutally I think we all know someone like Paul. Bette is a control freak who wants a solid plan and as we all know, Life does not go according to plan. So these two people dance around each other.I will disagree with another review about ""all the sex"". The author gives you details to set the scene and room and the emotions, but there is not erotic details of sex in this story. The author allows you as an adult to use your imagination to create with the use of her words that are beautifully written. I thought the title of her book would give away the storyline, but it does not at all. It's nice to read a romantic book with charming Paul disarming Bette with helping her find a house and then getting upset about the house she chooses. He introduces her to his parents in the first or second date and she is wondering if he really is afraid to be tied down or is he playing her to get what he wants?

Alex has always loved Anne in silence.  Now it's up to him to woo her away from Charles' memory.  Little by little, Charles' wastefulness, carelessness and lack of concern for anyone but himself become evident even to Anne.It's a pretty love story, a slow and charming romance where the heroine gradually sees the worth of the honorable brother.

2056,2056,"4 1/2 stars""Tarnished Knight"" by Shiloh Walker is Book 4 in her `Grimm' Circle' series. Continuing on her theme of reworking fairy tales to their Grimm counterparts, Walker centers this novella around Perci, just as she is cutting off her long golden braid (a la Rapunzel). Paired with her blind partner Luc but tied together by past tragedy and remembered love, the duo have been in stasis for centuries while Luc yearns for the love that Perci can no longer give. Their mysterious leader Will forcibly separates the tragic duo and sends Perci on a journey. She arrives just in time to save the mysteriously knowledgable yet mortal Jack Wallace from the three demons he is fighting against. Perci is oddly drawn to the prickly Jack and suddenly discovers that her heart and libido aren't aren't as frozen as she had thought but she certainly doesn't want to be tied to him and betray the man who has loved her all these long years. The problem is, somehow she also has a history with Jack, improbable as it seems.This is another sensual and enjoyable addition to the collection of reinvented fairy tales created by Ms Walker. The searing passion between the main characters and the gradually unfolding tale of events that occurred in the distant past combine to make a mesmerizing story. The constant switching in points of view is a little disconcerting at first but does not detract from the emotional read. A great addition to the series.

2057,2057,"This book was amazing! All else in my world came to a halt as I became deeper and deeper engrossed in the book. I could not put it down. I truly did not know what to expect from the book when I read the preface. I wasn't sure how gory the book would be and I was worried that I would not be able to complete the book.The book drew me in and I was unable to put it down. It was full of emotion and suspense and it was next to impossible to figure out what the next page held in store. I fell in love with characters. They were honest and raw.Jesse, a young undercover cop, is a sassy young woman with bad attitude and news written all over her when she shows up looking for work at Morgan's farm.Morgan, sporting her own emotional scars from years gone by meets her match in the saucy young girl, seeing herself in Jesse.Ry, Morgan's life partner and retired psychologist, sees through Jesse's smart mouth and attitude and is determined to help her face her demons.Three women, hanging on for the ride of a life-time, manage to make it through tumultuous days on the farm where Morgan fights to keep her temper in check while all the while wanting to either throttle Jesse, or fire her. Jesse, unconsciously feeling the security that Morgan doesn't realize she gives, tests Morgan at every turn. In the security of these two women, Jesse's hidden memories of the abduction and torture begin to surface, and Morgan and Ry are determine to save her tortured soul.The book has a powerful message contained within its covers. It is a story of courage, of betrayal, of learning to trust again, and in its own way, a coming of age. The descriptive text used throughout the story leaves you spellbound; the plot well written.Alison captures the essence of the tortured mind of a young undercover cop who subconscious buries a time of abduction and torture by a drug Lord.

Neal is a teenager who has seen it all and turned out to be very mature.

2062,2062,"Neal Marchal has led a troubled existence ever since her dad died.  She's begun to rebuild her life and escape her crazy life with her stepmother and stepfamily.  She has done her best to be invisible but it did not stop her from being a witness.  To what?  She'll never tell.  Or will she?What struck me first about this book is the main character Neal.  Neal drew me in right away, though I didn't care for her name.  A common piece of writing advice says writers should write in at least one flaw for their characters, to make them seem more believable, more real.  The author did a superb job in this.  Neal's limp made her weak and strong.  Her fears were real and at times she was afraid and untrusting to a fault.  I was captivated by her immediately.  I am not sure how that happened because character-building usually takes time.  Not in this book, though.  I read and kept reading because I cared about what happened to her from the very first page.  Well done!Curiously, I found myself breaking away from reading this book to look up songs on YouTube.  (That was a first for me.) I really wanted to hear the music in this book.  (I am disappointed I do not have a playlist from the author, but hope to remedy that soon.  If I do, I will post it.)  I imagined scenes unfolding at times as in Walk the Line, not that I was picturing Joaquin Phoenix or Reese Witherspoon.  I guess I got caught up in it all.  Looking back though, I could definitely see this being made into a movie.The ending was quite curt.  The book is the first in a trilogy.  However, if the first chapter of the second book had not been included, the end of this book would have indeed been too abrupt.This book is for young adult readers.  It does not contain any sex and is not gory or violent.  Any violence is recounted as a second-hand story.  There are no mythical creatures, but there is a monster.  Abuse exists within Neal's stepfamily.  It leaves a bad taste, as it should.  This is the teenaged version of Sleeping With The Enemy.  The author conveyed the paralyzing fear that comes from emotional, psychological, and physical abuse very well. I mention this as a warning to readers.  If this hits close to home or you simply cannot handle someone else's story of abuse, maybe skip this book.  If you are unaware of what living in an abusive situation may be like, maybe you should pick this one up.  Stories like this one need to be told and they need to be read. As a mother myself, I am reminded what a large part of someone else's life I am and what an awesome, fragile responsibility that is.No bad apples here.  This book was an easy, fast read.  I don't say that often about books.  I started this book and before I realized it, I was halfway done.  Seriously.  I am a slow reader but I read this in no time at all - one day. That really says something about the way it was written.  I am not talking about grammar or word usage.  I mean the method the author used to weave the story worked extremely well.  This is my first read by this author but without hesitation I would read another book written by her.Indeed, I am looking forward to burning the midnight oil with the second book in this series, Burning Daylight.Disclaimer: All books reviewed by me have been received via purchase, lending, or given to me by an author or publisher for the purposes of an honest review.

I am not a political junkie at all but this story isn't what you think. This E book was recommended to me (thanks to S ) and I wasn't sure what I was in for but I got addicted right from the beginning to the very last sentence. I have stayed up very very late reading it because it was worth losing sleep over this story . There are 3 more E books and another coming in this series and the minute I finished book one I started book 2 . I bought all 4 of the books in this series because Mr. Truscott's writing is wonderful and his descriptions of all his characters are right on target and very vivid images that makes a reader think they could reach out and touch many of the characters arm or whisper in their ear.No spoilers by naming these characters but I know that you will really get attached to some characters and will want to give some characters dope slaps. I went through many different feelings, rolling my eyes many times, smiling happily at times, very sad a few times, saying to my self- ""oh no, more BS from this character yet again"". I loved the cliques, the dry sense of humor, and the work ethics and dedication of some of the characters to do their job. This story reminds me of the election we all went through for the past few years, all the bashing ads over and over and over again of candidates and the millions of $ wasted on these types of elections is pathetic JMHO.For me, Chris did a great job putting this story together with all the characters he had to mentally come up with and what part every single character would play, how they looked, dressed, acted and all their thoughts etc.Great job and kudos to you Christopher Truscott.

2076,2076,"Another good book delivering news about life and death needing to be comfortingly heard. The words sound so right, no mumbo jumbo religious take, just the simple truth that living is about loving, beyond the realm of death pain and sorrow. When theses notions are instilled early on in our children, we free them from the heavy weight of doubt, guilt, lots of sorrow.

2077,2077,"This book is well written, has good character development and storyline. It's told from the perspective of several characters, which can be a bit confusing using Kindle's Text-to-Speech, until the fact dawns on the reader / listener.This took me several chapters, lol. For visual readers, each chapter is clearly marked by name of it's narrator. But even without, eventually their distinct personallies will make deciphering each simple.Once again this book has a &#34;New Age&#34; undercurrent, but add to it Wicca, Fortune Telling, Runes and you have a full blown Pagan feel. There was one part in the book that referred to the book &#34;Left Behind&#34; as &#34;Christian propaganda crap&#34;, and in the context of not wanting their child to read it.As for the rest of this book, again, well written ... The story revolves around a group of woman, those in their lives, andemotional hardships they face. I feel it's unfortunate that the Author chose to attack another faith while pushing spirituallity, relaxation, herbs and whatnot of every other non-Christian belief.

2084,2084,"Not for the faint-of-heart. This is not my normal read. I can usually be found cruising the comedy and chicklit aisles. I met Mel Comley on FaceBook and decided to check out  her ""Justice"" series based on all the stars she was wearing.:)  I'm glad I did.I know British bobbies don't carry guns, but I thought homicide detectives MUST be armed. What a shock to discover these heroes face death unarmed. When Lorne Simpkins comes barreling down on the illusive arch-criminal, the Unicorn, gun or no gun, watch out!As the story progresses Lorne's daughter is kidnapped, at that point I couldn't bear the tension. I had to put the book down for a day. I was literally shaking and my heart was racing. But I HAD to know what happened next. This is more than a page-turner.The characters are well drawn, the plot is terrifying. I look forward to reading the other books in the series.

2087,2087,"Wow! This was another winner from M. Comley. The action starts from the first page and lasts until the very last page. The author is not afraid to do what it takes, even risking ticking off the reader, to take the story in a different direction. And it works really well for her. This is not for the faint of heart for sure! This second book deals with a nasty mass murderer, drug and teen prostitution trafficking ring leader, the horrible Unicorn, who has it in for DI Lorne Simpkins. He seems to always be one step ahead of everything they do and this book takes us all over the place, tracking down leads, chasing his captives and evetually to an ending that still makes me shudder. The Unicorn has to be one of the top villians I have ever read about. Comley has quite the imagination to come up with these storylines and characters, and to make them believable to the reader takes a lot of skill. She is one of the best writers in regard to character development I have ever read--and I have read a ton of thrillers! You will enjoy the edge of your seat, crazy ride all through the book that this nasty murderer leads you and at the end you will be left breathless.

When one of my favorite Amazon reviewers (who goes by the sobriquet Old Latin Teacher) wrote that this book was the next best thing to a Georgette Heyer, I became curious.Well, Old Latin Teacher was right. This is a charming, witty story of a rake and a bluestocking, with delightful characters and sparkling dialogue. There's no sex, which I miss, but hey, I've got an imagination. And annoying Uncle Clarence (a painter who doesn't realize that he has no talent) is one of the most hilarious, original characters I've encountered in a long time.

The day after he died, Abby meets and sleeps with Ryan who she happens to get pregnant by. She decides to pass the child (Trish) off as her late husbands because no one knows about Ryan.At a gallery showing for her late husbands artwork, Abby is bombarded with questions and comments from all of these pretentious and fake people trying to keep Ben's memory alive. One of the worse ones is Hans Bunian. Hans is also an artist that her late husband Ben admired and that she made the Godfather to her daughter.Hans convinces Abby that her daughter should become a artist and has her taking art lessons and creating art. Hans is also a Bully, who acts more like the child is his instead of hers. Abby doesn't seem to have a backbone and allows Hans not only to bully her but, also her daughter.10 years after their first encounter, Abby sees Ryan again at the Gallery and immediately tried to avoid him because she doesn't want him to find out about his daughter. After a few encounters, Ryan figures out that Trish is his daughter and decides that he isn't going to allow Hans to continue to Bully his daughter or Abby.Ryan is a refreshing part of the book, the only part that I really liked.This story was so unrealistic, I mean who allows not only them self but, also their own child to be bullied by someone when all that they have to do is break all contact with them?",1,0,0.530944625,0.078175896,CA
2094,2094,"Warning:  spoilers in this reviewThis book could have gone to a 5 star review for me if the author had:- not had the rape scene.  It is just too disturbing to think about and then the way the main character was able to recover from it so quickly felt callous to real world rape victims, ignoring how traumatic and devastating such an experience like that is.  The author doesn't go into detail about the rape, but for an escapist romance story, no one wants to know that the heroine had to endure that during the story- the main character is introduced as a top-in-her-class engineer employed to examine alien technology.  She came across though as a lousy engineer when she's on the trader's ship for weeks and does nothing to understand the ship better.  She had a talking computer for gosh sakes - she could have tried to uncover tons of information about the ship, other worlds, whatever!  It isn't until they land that she starts employing her intellect.  I really hate it when the heroine is depicted as such a dummy- the 4th guy added to her dance card.  Hmm, that could have worked if the heroine knew more about his personality and not just for the sexual attraction. Otherwise, she just  comes across as a whore.  Daeman came across too crude for me with his derogatory name calling.  I could see there being a 2nd book developing this relationship with him and the author is certainly talented enough to even add the other two demon looking guys to the ""harem"" and making it look right. I've noticed that the author consistently rushes the ending, like she runs out of inspiration and this affected this 4th relationship.Okay, now that I have all the negative out of the way.  Why the 4 stars - because there was something incredibly sweet about the Hirachi gladiators treatment of her.  I know some of the reviewers found the ""you Tarzan, me Jane"" dialogue frustrating, but for me it just made them seem that more sweeter.  The world building was great as usual with this author.  If, and I hope there is, there is a part 2 to this story, I would definitely buy the book.",1,1,0.5628019320000001,0.5628019320000001,CA

2098,2098,"This was a craaaazy mismash.  Could not figure out what the author's point was?  World Peace?  Seriously, there's a fairly long scientific discussion of the importance of bees and polination and world devestation without them (which is cool, I follow bee health, but seemed totally forced and out of context) and a mysterious jade statue that - like a butterfly's wings flapping will make a typhoon, regulates the bees. But there's also Costa Rican jail, armed mercenaries, falls down jungle cliffs, nights spent out in the jungle by someone who would be more likely to be on the ""Real Housewives"" series - and a jarring disconnect as a love story rekindles and grows, and a character finds ""herself.""  It was kind of fun until the lectures and the navel gazing revelations and the absolute crazy disconnect of glossing over what started it all.  That was odd and really took away from the book, as did the focus on bees when I'd so much rather have been reading about the aromatherapy healing cures found in the rainforest - odd that that was given very little importance compared with the ""man's"" work!  Would have been dissapointed if it hadn't been free.  I was also equally confused about the message sent to women by the author, as the heroine found her personal power she also found a lot more self blame and a lot less justifiable blame.  I really questioned the explanation of the opening scene as the SLIGHT SPOILER!!!contrast between I had to do it, and I was doing it wispering Spanish endearments was jarring, and made it all the more unlikely for such a happy ending.",1,0,0.598101266,0.401898734,CA
2099,2099,"One of the funniest books I've read in a very long time. The main character is the perfect anti-heroine which makes you warm to her even more. Although the situation she is in is crazy and fantastical (yes, other reviewers are correct in saying the story isn't realistic but then most romances are far from realistic - don't we read them for the fantasy element?), you can believe she is a real person, with all her insecurities and desire for home comforts, yet stoic ability to just keep going and survive her ordeal. This definitely isn't your average romance novel but the exploration of ""love"" is far more believeable. There are so many scenarios in this book that had me belly laughing out loud, which is rare. I hope others enjoyed it as much as I did, but don't read this if you are looking for a boy-meets-girl or steamy romance. This is a woman-disgusted-by-husband-has-adventure-and-finds-her-way-back-to-husband story, and the only steam is from the humidity of the jungle or coming out of her ears in anger.",1,1,0.537688442,0.621745089,CA
2100,2100,"As a connoiseur of zombie fiction, I'm always pleased when I stumble across a zombie tale that brings something different to the table. In this case, the tale is set in England. Yes, England, land of the 2012 Olympics, Monty Python, the stiff upper lip and very few firearms. So, can you make a good zombie story without guns? Based on results, most definitely and refreshingly so!The plot is good, the characters likable and the dialog, once you get used to the British style of banter, enjoyable. The characters seem genuinely human and are definitely not of the superhero sub-type from which zombie-lit so often seems to suffer. They suffer, make mistakes, learn from their experiences, endure tragedies and, in so doing, you come to care about them.The sole complaint I had was the annoying error of dropping the ""s"" from the word ""she"". It got so bad that for awhile I was questioning whether the main character might be gay since his wife's actions were always ""he said this"" or ""he did that"". Not that there's anything wrong with that, as Seinfeld might say. Still, as the genre goes, with it's general host of misspellings and syntax errors, this was a minor mistake that eventually sorted itself out and didn't end up detracting from a thoroughly fun and different read.

I honestly didn't believe they were actually engaged until the heroine spoke of the wedding in a rather blas&eacute; tone. It didn't quite fit in with the rest of the book. I found it rather endearing what the Big Secret turned out to be. It made the hero even more likeable and I was frankly solidly in love with him from the very first insult he uttered. I am convinced that the heroine is actually pretty. She doesn't have to be if she is not, she is absolutely delightful, I love her voice. But I think she plays down her looks. This was almost a Taming of the Shrew book, but thankfully the author refrained from making the obvious comparison and instead chose to impart the similarity with the witty repartee of dialogue.

There is attraction between the two, which Marlee attributes to Stockholm syndrome, but Daniel thinks is because of something else.This short story was very different from what Ms. Frost normally writes. It was good, But seemed too short to develop the story properly. If Ms. Frost were to take it and make it into a full length novel, I think it would do very well.""In Sheep's Clothing"" by Meljean Brooks- 4 starsHere we meet Emma, who left Pine Bluff six years ago after she was attacked and turned into a werewolf.

Now she and Sheriff Nathan need to find the murderer before he becomes even more dangerous as a new werewolf.This story is great. Even though it is short, it allows for romance, suspense, and action.

2119,2119,"I like mice.  I always have.  As a child one of my favorite poems was ""Mice"" by Rose Fyleman.  [It starts with the lines, ""I think mice are rather nice.  Their tails are long, their faces small;  They haven't any chins at all. Their ears are pink, their teeth are white, They run about the house at night...]So when I saw this poem I had to see what it was about; and ""The Mouse and the Christmas Cake"" turned out to be a cute little poem with some delightful old illustrations.  The opening lines are:A pretty story I will tell,Of Nib, a little Mouse,Who took delight, when none where near,To skip about the house.Her little nose could sniff and smellWhere all good things were kept,And in the pantry well she knewThat mistress Pussy slept.It's attributed to our old friend, Anonymous.  I tried to find out the publication date and it appears to have been 1858.  It was published by the McLoughlin Brothers in New York, and if you are the sort of person that likes old quaint poems and artwork, you'll probably like this little download.As for children liking it:  it will probably be hit-or-miss as to the poem, but most older children will probably want to look at the art.Enjoy,Pam T~mom/poetry and mouse lover",1,1,0.653846154,0.763157895,CA

Amazon is correct, I believe, to allow this kind of thing as it isup to the market (us) to weed out the charlatans, quacks, frauds and ignorant.TIP: The book entitled THE KINDLE EXPERT, which I recommend, states that 30 pages is a fair minimum for .99 cent e-book. I agree, if those 30 pages deliverquality information. TKE and I agree that 60 pages really is the BEST number of pages for a short e-book priced .99 cents. But even if this sevenpager was handed down to Moses from God on concrete tablets $9.99 is asking for trouble.

She returns to Buell Creek, Oregon to stay with her aunt just long enough to fix up the house to sell. That's when she finds out that Brian Farris is living in the cottage. How could that possibly be? She and Brian were quite an item in college until she overheard something Brian said to his friend. She hasn't seen him in two years but when she does all those feelings come rushing back. Sara finds out the farmhouse needs extensive repairs and Brian seems to be the man for the job. Brian does excellent work but she's determined not to let him work on her heart. Brian is a new man since he became a Christian and is determined to win back the heart of the only woman he's ever loved. Can they each work through the issues they face and come to terms with the past to be able to forge a future or will past hurts and a old farmhouse keep them apart for good?Restorations was a great title for this story. It was about the restoration of an old farmhouse but it was also about the restoration of relationships. The author does a great job in reminding us of the importance of not jumping to conclusions, the importance of forgiveness but most of all, to be careful of the things we do because they have an impact later on in our life. We see that with Brian and I'm sure we've all experienced that at some point. I liked getting to know Sara and Brian and enjoyed watching them dance around their feelings with each other. I particularly liked Aunt Hattie. I think she added a great element to the story.

2147,2147,"FatedReviewed by Fran & posted at Under The Covers Book BlogThis novella was perfect to re-ignite my interest in this series.  I started it a while back and I kind of forgot about it, because, well...the neverending amount of books being added to my TBR.  And then I got this novella and remembered what I originally found appealing about this series.  The magic, of course!  In a sort of adult Harry-Potter-ish way, our heroes have magic powers, they can conjure up spells, use magic wands and can even teleport.  Of course most of them are looking for the one true mate.But not the Wolvesey brothers.  Ronan and Raiden believe that their family has been cursed and that if they mate with a female, she is destined to die and they will live forever alone and with the agony of losing a mate. So they pretty much go around ""shagging"" women.But then he met Kari, a human.  And even though he can't scent her as his mate his attraction to her is more powerful and the fever for her burns deeper than he can fight.I loved the fact that he's not part of the Doomsday Brethren yet.  He's just a regular guy as much as any 80 year old looking like a 28 year old can be, trying to save the woman he loves from impending death by not binding her to him.  And Kari was perfect for him, caring, understanding and willing to put herself out there and only fight him when he deserved it.But my favorite part?  The glimpses of Shock and Bram.  Ohhh I love those two.  Bram is funny and smart and perceptive and charismatic and did I mention hot?  And Shock is dark, sexy, brooding and....shady, a total badass.  I can't help but be scared of him but he makes my heart beat fast.The Brethren adds a few members to their ranks, not only Ronan and Raiden but also Tynan.

There is little a writer can do to change the angle on this one. There is also the difficulty of religion. Exorcisms in the western world are based in the Catholic faith. It takes a skilled writer to create a nuanced, complex story without falling into the for or against religious argument. Graham either lacks the skill or wanted to take sides here.William Peter Blatty's hand is all over this story. Bibles, Jesuit priests, and epileptic fits abound. Graham's story vanished numerous times to images of Linda Blair and pea soup. There is also a very religious subtext to the story. The protagonist moves from a borderline non-believer to a believer. ""She knew everything would work out. She had faith."" Throughout the story, there are repeated references to sin and guilt. I read these as implications that Cheryl (our possessed girl) was inhabited by demons because she had been corrupted by sin. A very medieval concept, particularly considering the stance the Church took toward women in the 1200s (the womb as a vessel for Satan and all that nonsense).I am still not sure if this is just a ripoff of The Exorcist or one of those religious tracts disguised as a horror story.

2168,2168,"""Lessons (and other morbid drabbles)"" by Michael Crane, starts out with a lesson, by defining what a ""drabble"" is: it is a very short piece of fiction written with no more than 100 words. This book contains 25 drabbles. Some are very amusing, some are real groaners, some are just ...ehhh. Overall, though, the book has entertainment value. If nothing else, it's interesting just to see how somebody can write a coherent story using 100 or fewer words. It makes a great filler, for those times you're waiting in line, or even sitting at a traffic signal, because it does not take very long at all to read a 100-word story! In fact, if the individual titles didn't take up so much space, I'm fairly certain each of these would fit on a single page.I'd have to say I recommend this book because it is somewhat unique (I'm sure there are other ""drabble"" books out there, but I haven't run across any yet). I also recommend it because it is entertaining and fun. Even those ""groaners"" are stories you will find yourself wanting to retell!",1,1,0.6184210529999999,0.660818714,CA
2169,2169,"Drabble or drivel, it's all the same in this little book of depravity. Do you gawk at accident scenes, long to see the horrible wounds in the body under the sheet or wish you had a job like mortician or medical examiner???  If you answered YES to any of these, then this book is for you. The author seems to have a fascination with torture, missing body parts, partial or full decapitation, violence against women etc..  Importantly, he shows that he has empathy...it's just misdirected toward animals rather than his fellow man.  I gave it two stars, because it is difficult to produce tiny tales of 100 words, and he has accomplished that 25 times.  I just don't feel the need to debase myself with this kind of perversity any more often than necessary.  How about you?",1,0,0.5776397520000001,0.046928915999999994,CA
2170,2170,This novel tells a terrific tale of a flood that unleashes ancient monsters on the local population in Illinois. I found it thoroughly engrossing and a most interesting and different read. It kept me turning pages to find out how the story ends.I would differ with some other reviewers who criticized the first person narration.  I liked it. It worked and really was the only way to effectively tell this story. Unfortunately the book does have some editing and proofing issues which cause me to drop one star from my assessment.But it's still a good read and a bargain at only  99 cents on Kindle.,1,1,0.589285714,0.5379464279999999,CA

2172,2172,"Just finished 'Unleashed By The Flood' by Michael James.  I know some will downgrade this book because of its somewhat stilted first person narrative and also for several misspellings and grammatical errors.  However, I'm looking beyond these obvious problems to the story itself.  Was the author able to tell a great yarn, and keep me wanting to turn pages to find out how the story ends.  I must say yes, indeed he did.  That's the most important thing to me and I think anyone who can do that deserves at least 3 1/2 to 4 stars.While reading this book I kept thinking of the wonderful black and white sci-fi/horror 'B' movies from the 50's.  Such movies as 'Tarantula,' 'Them,' 'The Beginning Of The End,' and many more. I had a small smile on my face while I read on, turning the storyline into one of those movies in my head. It has all the typical characters, the brave doctor and his wife who first identify and confront the problem of the ""monster.""  There is the scientist expert who wants to get samples and study the creature, hoping to gain a great scientific breakthrough.  There is the cantankerous sheriff, who at first disregards those attempting to warn the public, but then joins forces with them after learning the truth for himself. And finally the somewhat inept U.S. military is brought in, attempting to use force as a solution to the problem. There are many more wonderful characters in the ""cast,"" too many to describe here.I'm not going to say much more and ruin the story for anyone else.  If you enjoyed movies such as the ones I mentioned above, I'm sure you will like this story.  My suggestion to the author, Michael James, is please get yourself a good editor to go through your book, make corrections and give you some advice on how to rewrite it without the first person narrative.

Rae is as confused as confused can get. She is kissing everyone and is making connections with every otherworld person she comes across. The love triangle was unnecessary and really just made you roll your eyes at the book and think ""really?"". There was also a ton of inner dialogue of random babblings that had no huge importance to the story.

2184,2184,"Faries, just your average dainty, pale-faced, silver-tipped, winged creatures filled with the spirit of nature, bound by magic, and determined to frolic. These impossibly playful beings are often portrayed as medlsesome and sweet, but in Demon Girl, the fairies are anything but impish. These fairies are bound by magics and the anocrynistic rules of their tribes. They are fast, strong, and decidely violent ... and super bloody awesome.Demon Girl follows the story of Rae Wilder, an orphan growing up in a changed world, a violent and seemingly unbelievable, irrepairable world. The human race was almost wiped out by demons - vampires, fairies, shifters, and other creatures of the supernatural realm. The Clerics now protect the surving humans, hoarding them like cattle behind purpose built walls and fences designed to keep the demons on one side, and every one else on the other.Rae dances the fine line between following the rules of the Cleric and wanting to explore the unknown. She has always been a little different, even known as an outcast. She has few friends, and certainly doesn't think twice about slipping through the wall and dissapearing into the forest beyond.In a whirlwind of intrigue, action, and information overload, Rae is faced with a new world of possibilities. She uncovers the truth about her past, finds herself tied to a sexy fairie-boy called Breandan, and to top it off, somehow gets mixed up with a mysterious vampire known as Tomas.Did I enjoy this novel? The simple answer is yes. The first few chapters are filled with a riot of quick moving action sequences and enough unfolding plot that losing interest seemed impossible. The characters are consistent and easily likeable, I even found myself drawn to the characters with darker natures and appreciating their part within the story.About mid way through the novel I found the plot travelled in a few circles. Restlessness settled in where not too much happened as a lot of background detail was being offloaded. I did see the writer's perspective about the summarising of this information, but I still wanted the story to move forward. And, once it did, I had trouble putting the book down. Rae's continued self-exploration and confusing and often exciting trysts with seemingly unlikely characters kept my nose between the pages.Despite some spelling and slight grammatical issues, the text flowed easily. I have little complaint with this novel other than the fact that it ended. I will defnitely be seeking out the rest of the novels in this series.

2197,2197,Ok the first review with a two star rating had nothing to do with the story so let me tell you why I am giving this book a two star rating. First there isnt enough of a character development for me. Also the usage of sighs and giggls along with the word methinks got annoying. The characters were always sighing for this or sighing for that; it was in every chapter as well as giggling at the wrong moments and methinks were used way too much. Also as that reason sounded a little bit redundant so did some of the story when the characters would explain something they sometimes do it twice but worded it slightly different as if the authors forgot they already had it in the story causing the story to drag. Also the actions of the characters didn't make since to me either.....spoil alert.... the parents of the heroine jump to conclusions and don't believe her when she had been forced upon by her cousins intended calling her a whore.  Also she is seen unchaperoned by multiple people with the hero when they were hiding their relationship where I might add there was no romance development... anyways she was seen and even recognized by the king himself but never becomes ruined even when her father finds out. Instead he beats her in the street for all to see and apologizes later in the story like he isn't a bad guy and she accepts his apology!!!! Oh and when they run off to elope it takes a while for it to happen instead of eloping right away?? There were just way too many issues with this book for me.

2205,2205,"Book Review: Eco Station One by Edwin StarkReviewed by J Bryden LloydWriting Style - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent)The narrative for this book, from start to finish is excellent. The story is told in first-person, from the point-of-view of Senhor Eduardo Sinnombre, and from the first page, you are left in little doubt that this is a man with a... unique... view of the world he has found himself in. The plot is tightly woven around a small group of key characters, and the author works brilliantly to create the atmosphere throughout the book.Character Development - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent)I have to say, especially considering that several of the characters are a tribe of pygmies, a gorilla, a donkey, a cockerel, and several pigs... every single character seems to develop throughout the story, right down to the ever-stoned bus driver, and the ex-girlfriend/model, who... well... it's probably best to see for yourself. Although the narrator and his new partner develop far more than every other character in the story, no stone of any of the characters is left unturned by the author, and I'm sure every reader will find themselves bonding with the vast majority of this very, very memorable bunch.Descriptive - 5.0/5.0 (Outstanding)From being seated outside at the start of the book, to the final throws of observing the progress bar, and the boarding of the bus towards the end, there were no elements within the book where I couldn't feel and imagine the sights, sounds and even the tastes and smells as they were committed to the page of text. There were elements of this book where the descriptive was so vivid, I found myself drawn in completely... none more so than the build-up to the `catfight', which, despite my best efforts, I fear I shall continue to chuckle at for the foreseeable future.Language & Grammar - 3.0/5.0 (Okay)As has been mentioned in at least one of the other reviews, it is very apparent that this author's first language is NOT English. There are a lot of little edits throughout the book that could use a little TLC...However, before you decide that this is a ""deal-breaker"" (as I have seen many readers put, with regards to many independent books, on a great many threads), please believe me, in this case, IT ISN'T! Despite the errors, I think the best way to put it is... This isn't brilliantly written, but IT IS brilliant writing!When you read this, I urge you... no, I beg you... look past the errors and the little frustrating things that you will undoubtedly notice... they really aren't that important and they don't spoil the book. Alternatively, go and read the author's notes at the end of the book. For some, this might just be an insight into why some authors don't have first-class editing.Plot - 5.0/5.0 (Outstanding) - NO SPOILERSThis is a very original, well thought-out, and very entertaining story. The author shows an undeniable ability to tell the story carefully and methodically, from start to finish. The sub-plots (of which there are many) are handled well, and when things begin to come to a head towards the end... with the rescue mission, the fire, and all that follows, the author is not lacking in talent.General - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent)In summary, what Edwin Stark has produced here is a definitive, `must-read' work. It is hugely entertaining - in places you will either laugh aloud, or struggle not to do so - and if you genuinely don't find something in this book that you enjoy, I will be very surprised. On top of all that, it throws up some much needed lessons in the world of ecological damage.A hearty congratulations Edwin. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.FIVE stars.

2206,2206,"Edwin Stark has written a seriously funny book.  Eduardo has stumbled into a position at a rainforest outpost where he gets the opportunity to skim millions from the mega-corporation, Mucosoft.  All he has to do is survive the local pigmy tribe, a gang of desperado cousins, the fast-approaching road project that will close his window of opportunity, a steamy love affair, and the jungle itself.  Not a problem since he has a gorilla assistant, a maniacal bus-driving hippie, and the beautiful Marina in his corner (at least part of the time).It's quite evident that English is not Mr. Stark's first language, but the odd prepositions, word juxtapositions, and typos lend an additional element of the exotic to his writing, making it seem more authentic.  He effortlessly employs beautiful phrasing and on-the-money descriptions that would be hard to find in most books written by Americans.This book was absolutely delightful from start to finish - wacky, zany, madcap, slapstick, but very creative and imaginative.

Before Brianna even has breakfast she's confronted by a ghost named Martha who, it will turn out, may be Cooper's ex-girl friend. She was murdered about 20 years ago, judging by the price of milk. (Martha is wearing a supermarket checkout uniform and announces that the week's milk special is 75 cents a quart.)It gets this funny, frothy novella off to a brisk start. Cooper shows up to invite Brianna to his high school reunion - football, barbeque and beer. And that's just for starters. Add 33 partygoers including the ghost, attempted murder, a suspect on the lam, revelation of some nasty secrets, and you get a boatload of surprises at a not-necessarily-typical high school reunion on a hot August weekend.A short, fun read when you need a pick-me-up.",1,1,0.6779026220000001,0.838951311,CA

Brianna isn't too worried about the competition when Martha nestles into Cooper Jackson's side because, well, Martha is a ghost, but it does raise a few question about Cooper.

The main character, Kenana, is a strong willed young woman who is being forced to marry at the age of 18 for the good of her people.  Her new husband is an elderly prince who preyed upon her when she was a young girl.  Her guardian angel, Malluch, who she hasn't seen since early childhood, shows up right before her wedding.  He stirs up feelings inside her that she should have for her new husband and doesn't.  Yet, she still fulfills her duty as the prince's wife and remains faithful.  Malluch doesn't like that and becomes more pushy.  Kenana starts to wonder if Malluch really is her guardian angel.  Would her guardian angel purposely tempt her to sin?  Who really is her savior and where does her fate lie?I was surprised that I really enjoyed this book and I will be reading the 2nd in the series.",1,1,0.60591133,0.774806474,CA

I read a lot of books described as Christian fiction, but I've been very disappointed by the content of some of those books, especially when the book looks Christian, and reading the description would lead you to believe it's Christian, but you find out they're just bashing other religions.

While it was basically your typical romance with Bill having suffered a great tragedy that has turned him against God, I still found that it held my complete interest and never got boring. There was lots of interaction and dialogue between the two (I think I comment on this in all my reviews, but I do not like to read a romance where the hero and heroine seldom have contact or spend page after page on introspection about their past and why they cannot love again, or long descriptions of scenery), and the story moved quickly. Found sentence structure to be good as well--this can sometimes ruin an otherwise great book with short simple sentences that continually begin with ""He"" or ""She"". Guess that sounds dumb but surely someone out there feels the same. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a clean romance.

If you're looking for something with a lot of depth and complicated plots, these probably won't be the books for you.  But if you just like a light mystery with a little romance thrown in, you'll have fun reading these.  Maddie Springer does remind me a lot of Stephanie Plum, and the supporting characters are pretty funny.  It's true that there are a lot of stereotypes in those characters, but I could overlook that.  I loved Jack Ramirez (a lot like Stephanie Plum's Ranger and Morelli) and the relationship Maddie developed with him.  (She's lucky he didn't drop her like a hot potato, though, considering how much trouble she was always making!)For me, the negative aspect of this Kindle version (and the reason I only gave the series four stars) was the terrible editing.  I' ve found that to be true of many of my Kindle titles, and I suppose I should get used to it, but it seems that there should be someone who can put these titles in a Kindle format and not make dozens of errors.  For example, on one single page, the name Gisella was spelled three different ways.  I thought the editor wasn't sure what was correct and tried different spellings, thinking that maybe one of them would be right.  There were other spelling errors too, as well as punctuation and other grammar mistakes.  But errors aside, these were fun books to read.",1,1,0.615384615,0.692307692,CA

It also is home for a garrison that houses some of the most violent and deadly prisoners in the galaxy.On this day that is decidedly different, all the mine workers have abruptly left the planet with no explanation. None of the prison staff know what's happened. Soon tremors begin, and Rhonda Alendresis, medic and sometimes security guard fill-in, is chosen by Captain Cole Riggeur to accompany him on a mission to lock down the various levels of prison cells. They believe the mining company has made the prison earthquake proof. Unknown to them, this isn't true and the tremors have already up-ended level nineteen, deep in the bowels of the planet, freeing the deadly shapeshifter, Tomar, who soon releases dozens of other volatile criminals to form one of the most dangerous mobs that ever existed.Into this treacherous world go Rhonda and Cole. Soon they find themselves trapped deep underground, needing to evade the gangs of ruthless thugs from  every toxic race in the galaxy, while avoiding injury from the continuous tremors. Not only must they deal with the threat of the rioting prisoners, but with wildly erratic robotic carts, collapsing tunnels, and the greed of the company that ran the mines and were more than happy to leave the prison staff and their prisoners to their horrible fate. Rhonda and Cole have only each other to rely on and the constant pressure explodes their mutually denied physical attraction erupts into passionate lovemaking.Vijaya has crafted a tense threat that feels frightfully real and forces two quite different people together. What she also manages to do is keep the human element. I'm a Star Trek, Star Wars and Stargate fan. Not just because I enjoy the scientific aspect, but because the characters come alive. Too often, written science fiction gets heavily technical and the human side falls out. Not so with Vijaya's story. The nearly indestructible Tomar is incredibly ruthless and believable. Rhonda is a strong and resourceful woman and Cole is the man such a woman deserves. Together they escape the prison and the planet, and in a twist that can't be anticipated, they prevail over Tomar.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and even if science fiction is not your thing, I suspect you'll find it a great read, too.",1,1,0.6184210529999999,0.23684210600000002,CO

Some heroine she is, by the way, turning to jelly the instant he tries to sexy-time her. I can't decide whether she really loves him or if she's just horny from years of neglect by her husband.This would have been better full-length with the Eloisa James we know delving more into the thoughts of each character and laying the groundwork for their personalities.

I liked the novel, though I am rarely a fan of ""instant love"" stories.  And, for our characters, Mina and Blake, instant love is a huge portion of this story.  However, I was pleasantly surprised because John does a great job showing all the other characters' abhorrence to such a quick budding relationship, which I thought was great because I rarely see that in novels.  Usually all the characters are rooting for the new couple that's ""so in love,"" but in John's novel, that isn't the case at all, mainly due to the fact that, before Blake, there was someone else in Mina's life... but no spoilers.  I would have liked a lot more character development to show the budding love, but as this is a series, I'm sure we'll get more of that in the next few installments.I liked the inner conflict that Mina felt throughout the story as well.  I know that probably sounds strange, but I was 100% with Mina as she contemplated her decisions, and while I was on her side, I was also conflicted myself, and for me, that's the makings of a great writer--being able to connect the reader to the fictional characters.

It looks as if the company wanted to gain exposure by publishing a book of their own, only they did a really poor job. The information contained in this book often contradicted itself. Instead of clearly setting forth book marketing tips, it basically listed a slew of marketing information that can be found easily on the internet. Most authors who have researched book marketing online know that that information doesn't always match up; e.g., Don't give your book away for free - tell people where they can buy it... A few pages later: Don't underestimate the power of free...? So which is it?Some of the marketing tactics listed were for cheating the system to raise your rankings. I didn't care for that at all. They also recommended a book via author, however never mentioned the title of the book... I'm sure I could search the authors name, but unless he has only written one book, I won't really know what book they were recommending - not that I would read something recommended in this book anyway.Finally, I can't leave a review without mention the formatting of this book.

2276,2276,"I couldn't find anything to like about this book.  I didn't like the characters and found the background story on the main characters wasn't developed enough for me to care.  I think the author did herself a disservice because this first novel felt very rushed and incomplete.  We were immediately thrown into the action with characters we had not yet had a chance to get to know and care about.  Then again, what was there to like about the ignorant, money-grubbing Daisy, cunning and crafty Aiden or Peter the Lunk Head?  I was appalled when Aiden admired Daisy's intelligence when she was going on about her business plan talking about ""those people"" (Koreans) so ignorantly I actually winced while reading.  She didn't sound smart; she sounded like a bigot and a hick and someone too young and experienced to have a clue about the world outside of Hollow Creek, KY...which I guess is what she was.  Aiden was so outrageously conniving it was almost comical.  All he needed was a long mustache to twist while laughing maniacally over Daisy tied to a railroad track and the image would have been complete.  Peter was such a chest-thumping, keep-the-woman-barefoot-and-pregnant caveman that the moments where he was supposed to be breaking down and showing his softer side almost didn't make sense.  Also, when Daisy's big (and obvious) secret was finally revealed in a dramatic (and predictable) fashion to Peter; I didn't feel sorry for either character.  I was actually very happy that this little bit of drama had finally come to its predictable conclusion.On a side note:  I found it extremely annoying that Daisy and Peter kept referring to Jessiemae but we never met her.  Here was a character that sounded like she might have a little bit of complexity and she never makes an appearance in the story!!Anyway, I downloaded the second novel, Daisy's Choice, right after completing this bit of fluff and it immediately became apparent that the author tried to make up for what was lacking in the first novel by giving more background on these characters.  But at this point, I find these characters so revolting and unendearing that I no longer care to see them get to, what I suspect, is just another predictable happily ever after.  I returned the second novel and am certian I won't ever reread Aiden's Game.

2277,2277,I thought with all the positive reviews I would love this book.  Not! This book is horrible it starts fast (literally she is in love with one man in the morning and in love with another by the evening) and the premise of indecent proposal wasn't even done well.  The heroine I'm sorry I found her stupid and greedy.  She was the worst that you would think of someone from the country just ignorant she made us look bad.  So glad I haven't  spent the $5.99 a piece for the other two books in the series maybe if the price goes down.  I just don't see a billionaire being so enamored by a Black Country chick with no education and obviously no common sense that he will do anything to get her even offer her and her fianc&eacute; a million bucks.  Sorry for the spoilers but I found myself disgusted with Daisy and her treatment of Pete.  For those that love Aiden and Daisy together so much especially based on this book they deserve each other two crazy people together.  She was so in love with Pete and ready to marry him the next day until someone dangles a million dollars in your face and all you can think about is not your future happiness with the man you love but what you can do with the money.  Maybe she buys some self respect and common sense in the other books.  I am just so disappointed I really wanted to like this.  There is not explanation or build up to why Aiden like/loves Daisy so much.  I also just couldn't get past Daisy the only character I did like was Pete he was genuine and as a character I felt he was the most developed.  Daisy was who she was but in relation to Aiden I just didn't get that his character was developed enough to justify his like/lust/love for her.,1,0,0.543103448,0.026876268,CO

Even then I was on the fence, but the writing was entertaining, and from the page count I could tell it was a full length novel instead of the usual novella. I gave it a shot, and I have no regrets.Subject 12 is a fast paced book filled with action based in a world similar to our own where super powers, aliens, and magic are more than just pop-culture. The author does a very nice job of integrating what we consider reality with the reality of his world with just enough blending of history to make it plausible. The protagonist is an ex-merc on the run from his previous employer who is at a crisis point in his life. His progression through the story is organic and interesting.Pros:The protagonist found himself falling back into old patterns even after he consciously understood they were wrong due to previous conditioning and habit instead of just doing the right thing from the moment he realized he needed to change. He slowly internalizes the changes that need to be made and starts to become a better person.The action sequences were fast and gripping. The protagonists power was interesting, original and while powerful, had definite limitations.The protagonist grows in both his power and character throughout the book.Cons:The Protagonist is an ex-soldier, ex-mercenary. He was highly trained in all manner of small arms and explosives yet, he relied on hand to hand combat throughout the book, even when it was the riskiest method to accomplish his goals. Worse, we received no explanation for this odd behavior.Some minor editing problems.funny:The author closes the scene on a intimate moment with a G rating then opens the next paragraph with a much more intimate encounter.",1,1,0.5884057970000001,0.725603865,CO

It's part action movie with super powers, part violent odyssey to self redemption.  For all that it's source is the comic book genre this feels rather more real than a lot of superhero books I've read. I'm not sure I'd describe the main character as ""likeable"" but I'll quickly pick up book two in the series when its published and I'm a bit surprised this didn't get snapped up as a paperback novel as I have a feel it would especially appeal to a lot of male readers.",1,1,0.631313131,0.8156565659999999,CO

SPOILERS ALERT.Firstly, the plot is really nonsensical. We've two senior police officers with a) nothing else to do and b) an easygoing attitude towards letting interested members of the public see what's going on behind the scenes. Apart from the sheer unlikeliness of it, there's also the question of verbal evidence contamination, breaches of privacy and so on.Secondly, the point of view chops and changes so much that, if this were a film, it'd be quite unwatchable. There were times when I knew things that I didn't know because I was still inside the head of the character whose eyes I'd been seeing through a few sentences prior.Thirdly, the characters are very thin and cardboard cut-out-like. The women are gorgeous, the men are good or bad and the whole thing more than a bit contrived.I'm really pleased to say that there were some good points. The story itself has a fascinating premise (I liked that a lot), there was some light relief at times (liked that, too) and the setting stayed reasonably steady (some books can turn into travelogues) until the ending when it really lost the plot (pun intended) bigtime.British crime thrillers like this benefit from being gritty and realistic - this (very sadly) wasn't.",1,0,0.613138686,0.0,CO

2295,2295,"OMG, I loved this. I wanted to slap Gillibran most of the time, but he was also so lost and his inner pains felt so real that I couldn't resist him. I liked the menage. The three men are ten years apart, Gilli in his 20s, Dick in his 30s and Shane in his 40s. The age difference reflects also the difference in their upbringing and what they could or couldn't tolerate. Shane is the uber-Daddy, very strict and apparently unmovable, and Gilli is always, always pushing him against every logical reason. Dick is the hornier, but also the more tender-hearted, easy to forgive, probably because he is also closer to Gilli. Gilli is a brat. He can't resist his swinging moods, he lets his jealousy govern him and it seems he doesn't want to learn from his mistakes. The jealousy is understandable, because Shane and Dick had been together for almost ten years before Gilli became part of their household, so Gilli is always looking for confirmation of being a part of them and he gets plenty of confirmation through the many spankings he earns because of his attitude.Usually I'm exhausted by this type of characters, but Gilli is so transparent, so funny, that like Shane and Dick, I forgave him everything. He also has a tendency of wandering in his thoughts and I must confess that sometimes I felt I was preached on, but there's an entertaining lightness in the whole book, even when it scratches very painful feelings, without never going deep into them. It's as if Gilli, for all his openness and sincerity, keeps his intimate core very close and unreachable, to his daddies and to the reader too.Some editing issues drove me mad, especially alter for altar.Recommended, but be patient with the houseboy!",1,1,0.6023391810000001,0.751461988,CO

Jackson incessantly refused to explain the situation to Harper, as also leaving me in the dark to what the actual conflict is. As for Harper, she was oblivious to her surroundings. This was especially frustrating as her ""amnesia"" caused her to forget the start of her relationship with Jackson, which was one of my highlights of the book. Not only did she develop ""mysterious"" amnesia, she immediately chose to conform to society as a cheerleader, something which she previously claimed had no appeal when it was out of her reach. The other supporting roles were also incapable of peaking my interest, such as Harper's closest friend, Agnes and her ""shocking"" secrets and sealed fate.Cannon only succeeded in writing a story centred upon a quintessential high school hierarchy and a self-absorbed sophomore who is incapable of staying conscious for more than a couple of days. Personally, this does not suit my taste, in spite of the regular action and romance that I often find appealing.

I even disliked Edgar, her husband, until I find out why he acted the way he did.I started losing my sympathy for Catherine though, after her first sexual encounter with Adam.  Perhaps, one sexual encounter could be forgiven, as her husband more or less set up the scene for it. But it becomes inexcusable when she goes to London and becomes Adam's mistress.  This book would have been OK for me but I couldn't get over Catherine's infidelity, which made the book distasteful to me.  The writer tried to paint Adam as an honorable man by mentioning that several times in the book; but honorable men don't set up other men's wives as mistresses - no matter the provocation. I would have had more respect for him, if he had kept away from Catherine, even if he was in love with her. I could see little evidence that it was love - not lust - that drew him to her.I find the ending of the story unforgivable: after more or less causing Edgar's death, Adam climbs into bed with Edgar's wife, in Edgar's home, and falls asleep with her. I found that to be very insensitive, unbelievable and unreal.  I mean, who does that? Even if he were the nastiest husband on earth, which Edgar certainly wasn't, as he never physically assaulted his wife, she should still have been given some regard in her own home.  What would the servants say (I assume they were present)? And I believe Adam could have taken more steps to protect Catherine's reputation by not going away with her before her time of mourning for her husband was over. There were just too many holes in the story to make it a realistic Regency story with Regency values (which is the main attraction of historical stories).After finding out the reason why Edgar behaved the way he did, I pitied him. It is difficult to hate the victim of abuse, and if the author's intention was to make us hate him, she didn't succeed. I just felt really sad about the whole situation, and that is why I give the book two stars. The plot needs more work to generate real enthusiasm for the star crossed lovers. The story would have been better told as a modern day romance.",1,0,0.606924644,0.131025119,CO

Got the bit about the husband's condition straight away and actually felt sorry for him towards the end. Personally did n't like the hero either.

2309,2309,"Updated from March 12, 2012 to fix typos in review.Let me start this review with a brief synopsis of the plot as that is lacking in the description.The heroine, Catherine is in a miserable marriage.  She is married to a baron who, based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive.  Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues.  She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over.  The hero, Adam is an Earl who is ""lured"" to the castle for a pair of twin horses.  He meets Catherine and based on her looks, falls instantly in love with her.  The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married?  Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom?As I read this book, I find several things incredulous.  First, this ""love"" between Catherine and Adam isn't really that well developed.  I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time, and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband.  He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion.  However, based on what was told in this story, I am at a loss regarding Adam's love.  Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman (think, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc.).  I don't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband, but never directly to Adam.  Additionally, there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine's favors (she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next.  I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story, Catherine's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told.  I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right, perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall, I can't really recommend this novel unless someone doesn't care about infidelity.  I found this novel to be weak, the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine.  Yes, I finished it because frankly, I wanted to know more about the husband and, was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels.  Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together, the ending left a lot to be desired as well.  I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author.",1,0,0.5650623889999999,0.072489602,CO
2310,2310,"I couldn't bring myself to finish this book and believe me I tried.  My first attempt I literally skimmed through the book to get to the end.  My second attempt I finally gave up halfway through.  The author's writing style is to give a blow-by-blow account of EVERYTHING that happened, was said, or was thought, so for me, the story was much longer than it should have been. Catherine was portrayed as having a fear of her husband, but nothing I read indicated that he was in any way abusive towards her. Distant, yes.  Withholding of affection, definitely. Lacking manners, of course. But never abusive.  I couldn't get a handle on Adam especially when his lust overtook him (I literally grimaced reading some of his scenes, and I'm no prude).  Speaking of which, the few sex scenes I read left plenty to be desired.  The only reaction I felt reading them was the need to roll my eyes.  Perhaps this was the wrong first choice for this author but I'm unfortunately not inspired to read any more of her work, and this book will most probably be deleted from my library.",1,0,0.6126126129999999,0.055341055,CO

2312,2312,"With a title like ""Manual for Living: Reality-Time, a book can either can exceed your expectations or let them down horribly. The general gist of the book is that our perception and our attempts of controlling time are what actually cause us to have more problems including less time, more stress, and less enjoyment of life. If you have read ""The Secret"", this book kind of uses language similar to that, although with a deeper, more insightful focus and from a more advanced level. Also, if you have read Martin Gover's books like ""Time Control - Taking Control and Achieving Goals (Creating Lifestyle)"", the philosophy from that book is pretty much similar to this one.This book actually skimmed the surface. Some things about this book (language, insight, and of it match or even exceed what I thought it would be and other sections we (title, lack of concreteness, font changes) For a such a small book, it does pack a deep psychological punch and has a lot of what I call ""quotable material"", those little nuggets of information that you write down to post on your wall. On the other hand, like The Secret, the book doesn't really add anything strong solutions to implementing its philosophy into real life. For example, the book keeps pointing back to the point of balance and slowing down. I agree with this point, but there are no concrete steps or examples that show you how to start this. As a reader of time management books, I don't expect a detailed list, but I would like to see some action steps or take-aways I can use to get started. In that regard, I would say Martin Gover's book would be a little better in helping you with that. Still, this book does give a lot of ""food for thought"" for the price that it is (free) and the concise number of pages, it is a book you will want to consider for your spiritual and meditation study.I recommend this book for people who have read ""The Secret"", and those interested in spirituality (especially Buddhism). It is not a time management book per se, it is more of a philosophical and meditative reflection on time that you can use to realign and refresh your spirit and soul.Pros* Language: The book is written in the flowing style of ""wisdom literature"" with quotes throughout which readers of this type of literature should love.* Deeply Insightful Content: The book has a lot of poignant content delivered in a way that will make it immediate, accessible, and (hopefully) easy to remember.* ""Highly Quotable Material"" In all of the books I read (fiction or non-fiction), I look for what I call ""tiny little nuggets of wisdom"" or quotes that I can write down and remember for use in my daily life. This book is full of them.Cons* Title: On a personal level, the title was both a pro and con to me. On one hand, the title is epic and all-encompassing. On the other, the title is so all-encompassing, readers may not know what to expect. For example, I was a little confused about whether I would be reading a ""time management"" book or a personal anecdote about a personal understanding of time. It kind of turned out to be a little of both.* Lack of Concrete Steps: As mentioned before, the book is good on providing inspiration, but no so good in showing you how to apply that inspiration to your life.* Font Change: There are some sections in the text where the font is really tiny. It may be a publishing error, but it distracted me from reading a little.",1,1,0.6220362620000001,0.370060437,CO

2315,2315,"What is it about Greg F Gifune that makes me want to write a review, spread his fame and share his innermost thoughts and feelings with the rest of the world. First can I say if you are a lover of dark fiction and have never heard of Greg (where have you been!) then you are in for a treat, a treat that is not always an easy ride, a treat with no happy ending, and a treat that contains a collection of tormented souls who will never attain nirvana and who face each day full of regret and misunderstanding....welcome to the darkside!Lenny Gates a failed part time actor, living with an alcoholic girlfriend, is surprised when he receives information that his student love Sheena has died leaving all possessions to him. He sets out to investigate why this should be and is drawn deep into a nightmare of epic proportions. Sheena had discovered something, had unleashed something, never meant for it to happen but was afraid it could not now be stopped. It is the way that Gifune writes, more than the story itself, that makes Judas Goat a memorable journey into the mind of a lost soul full of regret and remorse...""Fighting with everything he had to keep his mounting terror at bay, Lenny backed into a corner of the room and slowly sank to the floor. He wrapped his arms around himself and stared at the lamp. Its light provided some comfort, but the paranoia and fear were winning. ..Lenny watched the glow for what seemed hours, clinging desperately to whatever bits of control remained. He felt like a helpless child lost at sea and struggling to remain above water. No matter how hard he fought, eventually he'd slip beneath the surface and die. He knew this, yet he continued to struggle. Had it not been quite so hopeless, he might've claimed it valiant. But the doomed had no such luxuries. He told himself he would not sleep could not sleep-but eventually did just that. As the waves overtook him, he swallowed night and spiralled down through liquid darkness to all that waited for him. There, in the horrifying depths of his own torment""The author treats the reader with respect and lays before him prose that allow him to question his own moralities and beliefs..""But one thing I do know is that we'll never be alive again like we are right now. It'll all be yesterdays and memories before you know it. And we'll both look back and give anything to be young and free again just for a day, an hour. No matter what happens, good or bad, we'll never feel this indestructible again""I think ""Judas Goat"" is an inspired name for this book...""It's a trained animal slaughterhouses and farmers use. It leads animals onto trucks or platforms and into pens, that kind of thing. It also leads them to slaughter. It betrays its own kind. You know, as in Judas Iscariot?"" When Lenny last saw Sheena he would never commit and he left her when she was most vulnerable, now this inheritance she has bequeathed to him may become his Judas Goat.So Lenny travels to Trapper Falls to confront his destiny and he is helped along this path by two memorable characters...Officer Meadows and his annoying scratching habit ""Lenny was sorry he'd called the police in the first place. Meadows had been annoying enough, but what the hell was this incessant scratching about? Did he have lice?"" and lets not forget big mean Gus Garvin the mad wielding Axe Man "" At close range the man smelled like he hadn't bathed in eons. It's ok, Lenny told him, fighting an urge to block his nose, you can put the ax down. I'm a friend....Without warning Gus lunged for him and swung the ax!.So a highly enjoyable read by one of my favourite dark fiction authors who continues to probe the deeper recesses of the human mind and by doing so produce some magnificent storytelling.",1,1,0.594278283,0.797139142,CO

Frankly, one raw sex scene after another got to be boring and i think the plot was only there in order to hold the sex scenes together.With all his talk of loving his wife, the fact remained that Michael committed adultery over a period of months (and just because he thought his wife was the whore he used for sex doesn't excuse his actions). I also took strong exception to his wife accepting even part of the blame for his actions; the blame for his adultery was 100% his! I am not a prude and I even find many of the sex acts depicted erotic if they are performed lovingly, but I agree with the reviewer that stated the language was coarse and vulgar. I don't think that the crudeness added anything positive to the story and I'm certain that Michael and Clarissa would not use that language at all and definitely not with each other.The most telling attribute of the Regency Period in England was there was a protocol for everything, even the specific way that a lady used her fan to show her interest in a gentleman. (I got that information from Google.) With protocol being so integral to society, this story was totally unbelievable.

2330,2330,"First off, I would like to say that this is very well written. The conflicts in the beginning are very believable and heartfelt. The characters are well drawn and I really feel for their plight. The love scenes are also well done, not raunchy.That being said, I don't like that he cheated on his wife. Granted, he's cheating WITH his wife, but he doesn't know that when he chooses to do it. So he still technically cheated. And not only that, but he enjoyed it, felt no remorse afterwards and made plans to do it again. And again. I lost respect for him after that.I'm about halfway through it, just after the first the point where he decides to have the affair, and I'm not sure I want to continue. Were I Clarissa, I would have been very hurt that my husband chose to have an affair with a ""whore"" (that's he calls her). It's not believable to me that this didn't even enter her thoughts when he cheated on her. Again, it doesn't matter that it is his wife; he doesn't know that. And now, reading other reviews on the Ellora's Cave website, I read that he has his wife assaulted? That's not sexy to me. Nor is a man cheating on his wife. I don't care if it's historically correct, that it might have been tolerated back then. Doesn't make it right.I read for escapism, a glorified fantasy. I want to see a man have morals, even in an erotic romance. And this isn't sexy to me.EDIT: Okay, I'm leaving my original review as it, but changing my rating and adding an amendment. I'd originally rated this two stars, and you can see above what I thought of it. I decided to give it another chance. I won't give it away, but the hero redeems himself. And the scene where I thought he was supposed to have had her attacked wasn't like that at all. The hero had figured out who she was, and knowing his wife, he was attempting to bring out desires she was too embarrassed to confess out loud.Oh and in the end, the heroine gets her ""revenge"". ;) So, in the end, I did end up enjoying this.

The story unfolds with a scoundrel trying to kiss the h. The H sees his wife in the kiss but does not see her slap the scoundrel. He becomes impotent after seeing his wife in the embrace. He heads out to a brothel and for a number of months relieves his frustrations via voyeurism. His wife follows him one day and the Madame tells her that he has only been with himself but he is wavering. She suggests that the h disguises herself as a French whore with a mask and be with her husband when he succumbs to temptation. The h does so and the H breaks down in a big way. He cheats on his wife with his whore wife. After his first tryst, he is hooked and looks forward to each visit. I stopped reading and started skimming about here.When the H was cheating, he did not feel guilty about the wife at home or the kids. All he could think with was with his d*** and what it wanted. He thought about being with the whore quite often when he was looking forward to cheating on his wife after the first visit. The entire story seem to focus on sex in various forms...bondage, toys, and voyeurism. I feel what was missing was a story....and some feelings between the two characters.Not a recommend unless you are looking to read about a bone head H who has been married to the h for almost 2 decades and does not recognize her body?

2335,2335,"""Nannie's Moon"" is a sweet children's story of a grandmother teaching her grandchild about the phases of the moon by comparing the shape of the moon to everyday items, and also about the stages of growing tomatoes in her garden.  Each day they check on the growth and the grandmother explains each stage, from flowering to the final, nice, round tomato to her grandchild.There are some very nice sentences written by this Southern author who writes literary fiction, such as in Part 2 when the child brushes Nannie's hair.  ""She says her gray hair used to be blond like mine.  When I brush her hair, it crinkles like autumn hay.  Her hair is the color of the moon; mine is the color of the sun.""  The use of a season and colors sets a mood and the contrast between child and adult.Illustrations would enhance the story for children, but I found the story to be quite sweet and tender, but for a child older than toddlers.  I'd place it in the 5-7 year-old age range.The description says 3 pages, but it was longer than 3 pages on my Kindle.

Granted I suppose I was kind of asking for it by reading a novella that includes romance but still it's something that just makes me cringe.The author does have a fairly nice writing style and the idea overall is decent. I think if Bevill had spent more time developing the story and exploring the characters this could have been a pretty good read, but as is...it's just a rushed romance with a side of whimsy. In fact it's mostly romance after the two main characters meet, and some of it just came off as ""I'm confessing my love the second I meet you to progress the storyline quickly.""It's okay if you are looking for a short read and nothing deep but don't go into expecting too much.

2344,2344,"First, I will say I downloaded all three novellas in the Moon Trilogy and have read them all. The summaries seemed interesting and the free price...well you can't beat that.However, I was not impressed with the novellas. They were just OK. The idea behind each of the stories is great and have excellent potential. The execution of the idea is where the problem begins.This trilogy is marketed as novellas and rightfully so. They are very short, couple hours read at most. However, just because they are novellas does not mean the story has to be shorted.I felt that Black Moon, especially, was shorted. There is very little if any character development. There is no build up to the intimate scene between the two main characters. Basically, they meet, are immediately attracted to one another and then have sex. There is very little background to add to the characters. They are a bit bland, and left me wondering who they really were. The secondary characters are also very bland with very little said about them than they're the bad guys. I think there should have been more background there as these secondary characters (the wolf pack) come back further into to trilogy to play a more prominent and vital role in the overall story.The plot felt too rushed. The sex scene took up to much of the overall story. I felt much of that could have been used to further the storyline and build a better plot. It starts out good and on the right path then the middle just stalls out on the sex scene and the ending feels rushed. It's like the final showdown or the finale is there and then just as quickly over. The build up to it is bland as well.As the first of the trilogy, this book should have had more insight into the overall plot of the trilogy, the importance of the book as well as the other two pieces, which our the primary premise behind the next two books. It should stand alone, but at the same time intrigue the reader to want to read more. This one did not, and book two almost seems more of a first book into the trilogy with Black Moon not really fitting in. It's was kind of like Black Moon was written and then the author got the idea for the rest of the trilogy but didn't go back to smooth out Black Moon to fit in and lead into the rest. I would say book two and three were better with more defined and developed characters and better plot execution.There are also many editing issues. A simple proofread before publishing would have corrected much of this. The editing does seem to get better as the trilogy moves on, however. The editing issues are a bit distracting at times, but I have seen much worse.On the upside, the storyline and the world created are excellent, unique in their own right, and intriguing. And, this could very well be my main problem with these novellas. I was very interested in the overall storyline and the world created, but left feeling shorted. Like there was so much more that could have been done with this story. Honestly, I think the overall storyline would have been better served as three full books with better development and more defined detail. I just felt there was too much missing and left untold like this was the cliff notes version.I have read other works by this author, and find some of them to be much better. Actually, I've just purchased another of this author's works. I don't think this was the author's best work, but I feel it could very well have been if it had been better planned and prepared.Overall, it's not a bad read...just not a great read, but for the price it's not a waste.",1,0,0.565698479,0.248172298,CO

I have to concur with the other reviewers - Winter Wedding is one of my favorite Joan Smith regencies and I say that after reading about fifteen of them in the same number of days!Clara Christopher, the heroine, is a very likable character.  Despite her somewhat straightened circumstances (she is orphan who lives off her relatives by ""visiting"") she has a wonderful demeanor and is always helpful to her hosts.  She is not a ""poor me"" heroine, but rather one who enjoys her existence as ""an eternal wandering guest.""At the beginning of the novel she is residing with the family of her cousin's fiance Prisse and helping the girl's ""nipcheese"" mother, Lady Lucker, plan the wedding.  She learns that Lord Allingcote, whom she quite liked when she met him at house party two years ago is actually Lady Lucker's nephew and may be coming to the wedding.  He does arrive, albeit with the uninvited and incredibly obnoxious, but stunningly beautiful neighbor Nell.  Nell sets out to aggravate Prissie and Clara steps in several times to ensure that the wedding occurs without a hitch as she is quite fond of Lady Lucker.In the midst of the approaching wedding and Nell's increasingly aggravating antics, Clara and Allingcote spend quite some time together and while there are plenty of clues from the start that Allingcote is seriously enamored of Clara.  Clara has some very good reasons for believing he is just a flirt and subsequently doesn't pay him the same attention he gives to her.Thankfully, there is isn't some contrived misunderstanding, just a gradual development of a relationship between two nice and funny people who like one another very much and who have a big obstacle in the form of Nell to overcome.  Nell didn't bother me because she provides a good foil for Clara and because Clara has some pretty funny conversations with Allingcote about his tolerance for the Nell's behavior and his typically male reasons for believing Nell is not such a bad egg.Altogether, a funny and clean romance with very likeable main characters, as well as a treasure in the nipcheese in money, but generous of heart Lady Lucker.",1,1,0.578817734,0.6841133009999999,CO

Think of this as a nine course meal best enjoyed in the proper order for full enjoyment, beginning with the before dinner wine. (Harry loves wine!) Start with ""Emma"" for the beginning of Harry and Cat's relationship and progress through ""Angie,"" ""Annie's Dream,"" ""Harry's Lament,"" ""Short Round,"" Sister's,""  ""Sophie's Gambit,"" and ""Harry's Game"" to finish with ""Dead Dead Dead, The Little Girl Said.""

Harry is a believable guy who is facing geezerhood and has told the world to shove it. Cat is just cat. I'll say no more to spoil the reading experience.Trust me, take it from the top, get to know Harry and Cat book by book and you may find yourself, as I did, finishing up this literary feast at 4:18 AM in the morning saying, ""Damn, that was fun!""Dan WintersHampton, Virginia",1,1,0.6793650790000001,0.83968254,CO

Like the other two books in the series, this final one is told from a single perspective (the heroine's), third-, rather than first-person. Because both of the heroes are aliens with, er, special equipment, there were more squee moments for me in the sex scenes (m/f, m/m, m/m/f) than when there was at least one human male involved. But if you don't have problems with shape-shifted sex, then it probably won't bother you here. Even without that element, the BDSM pushed my envelope (and I have a pretty high tolerance). The romantic aspect (and there is love and affection) is blended well within the context of the sex and the action and the plot (all well-balanced).

Maryse is trying to get her life together, as it's falling apart, her life is endangered, and she meets a new hot guy. Her bumbling ghost of a mother-in-law, who thinks she's helping, only serves to cause more problems initially. They learn how to make the situation work for them as they solve the mystery.

2412,2412,"""Winter Fire"" was a touching story of two emotionally wounded people who came together and healed each other through the alchemy of a deep and abiding love (even though Ethan fought against loving Zara).After being captured as a child, Zara was adopted into an Indian tribe and was completely assimilated into their world until she was forcibly expelled for the crime of being a witch. (This was necessary to the story but didn't fit in with what I know of many Indian cultures, who would have honored her for having visions.)  She was given over into the custody of her uncle who was a cruel, greedy man who planned to force her to marry his son to get a hold of her inheritance. After attempting to run away, Zara was severely beaten and almost raped by her uncle and ran away again. Ethan saved her when she fell through the ice, learned that she was an outlaw but decided to help her escape anyway. I don't want to say anymore and risk spoiling the story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the storyline as well as a surprise (a happy one) ending.The writing was very well done with only a few editing mistakes that didn't interfere with the smooth flow of the story. I liked the fact that all the talk in the Indian's language was translated right after it was written.

The night before her wedding, the two sneak out unchaperoned for one last sisterly moment of bonding, when the unthinkable happens and they are kidnapped by two wandering Vikings. They believe Gwendolyn to be male (in men's clothing and short hair) and take the duo back to their ship in repair, even though it is expressly forbidden by the captain, Hakon. From here on out, the story is about Hakon and his interaction with the 'brother' Garric and sister Anora. Gwendolyn continues her identity as Garric in hopes to keep Anora's virtue intact for her betrothed.Well, the one thing that attracted me to the story was the outline. As most of these stories go, I thought I could have predicted what happened, but unfortunately, I think my assumption was probably a better story than this. I found the story to be trite, shallow, messy, and incredibly misogynistic. I know well that most romance stories have a bit of misogyny in them, but this one was pretty thick with it.Let me start with the storytelling. It's messy in that it is constantly vacillating point of views. One paragraph is through Gwendolyn's eyes, the next is Hakon, and then the next one is some chambermaid in the same room giving her $0.02. So it goes on. It took me many chapters to get used to it. And yes, I did read the whole thing (mainly in hopes to see a redeeming quality in the couple).And the descriptions, whoa. Adverbs stacked on adjectives stacked on adverbs. I like description, but most of it felt forced or trite, as if there was a book of synonyms on the ready for *every* sentence.Also, the beginning of the story held a lot of completely unnecessary crap. If the story is not going to be about Wulfgar and Anora, maybe one should stop writing such intricate details about their history and the political notions of it all. When it doesn't last past the first few chapters, never to be touched upon again, I feel like my time is wasted with pointless words completely lacking in entertainment or reason.The twins' ruse was poorly written. I believe another reviewer noticed the same. How can the both be so incredibly fair and beautiful and gorgeous and gifts of the gods when one can be so easily mistaken for a young boy? I absolutely hated Hakon as a character, but it was laughable to read the spew of compliments he would bestow upon Anora, then hate so easily on Garric without any inkling of her identity, then praise Gwendolyn (as Anora) exactly the same - never the wiser! Yet every chapter some background character made a comment on how absolutely magnificent and awe-inspiring was the beauty of either...but only if they were in a dress. /eyeroll/ Put some pants on a girl and she's too mannish to believed to be a girl. Riiiiight.Now to the 'romance' of Gwendolyn and Hakon. Not once did I feel any genuine love between the two. For chapters, Hakon praises his affections and lust for Anora, from the very beginning. When they are first discovered on the ship, the reader anticipates a kind captain with morals, but instead the reader gets an arrogant warrior who's okay with raping and taking some hostages as slaves. While I get his reasons for not turning around and dropping the twins back off at England, did he really have to enforce slavery? Not only slavery, but insist on getting Anora to bed him as some kind of sex slave (incredibly confidently, I might add). I get that this was probably exactly the kind of man one would expect in this era, but it's not very attractive to read about in a romance novel. So not only is he constantly forcing his affections on an incredibly frightened Anora and just scaring the bejeezus out of her with his talks of forcing himself upon her, but he doesn't even get a whiff of difference when Anora and Gwendolyn change places. Absolutely nothing is amiss to him. The first night Hakon and Gwendolyn (as Anora) are together...it's just very...rape-y. He does force himself...but it's some kind of weird thing that Gwendolyn (all this time has completely hated and disgusted by this guy) just turns over like a cat in heat all of a sudden. I think, as a reader, one is supposed to just accept that her body knows what's best for her heart...or something like that? Even through the realization of love and all that, Hakon never knows who's who. I mean, I would think true love should at least be able to see a person past their indescribably beautiful body to fall in love with someone and then fall in love with an identical someone without realizing the difference. It just leaves the romance's credibility in the negative.This also applies to Gwendolyn. The reader does not come across her transition into loving him. She's wishy washy and just moody. She hates him because he took her and her sister as slaves away from her homeland! She loves him because he's great in the sack! She hates him because he's so mean to her when she's Garric. She loves him because just look at that hot, Viking body! Once she starts pretending to be Anora, all plans to escape home are just gone. Months are supposed to go by, and Anora is just sitting on her thumbs trusting her sister. I just don't get it. I don't get any precourse to love beyond lust or obligation/duty/honor above whatever it is that feels good.I mentioned the first scene of intimacy between Hakon and Gwendolyn are...rape-y. Well, the acceptance of rape was one of the biggest themes that disturbed me. It wasn't outright acceptance, per se, but it was darn close. The constant attempts to rape the twins were disheartening, but then to have the 'hero' consider it so much...yeah, not cool. One line from a background character left me doing double takes:""Whatever happened to the days when a Viking chieftain took a wench if he wanted her, and that was that! She closed her heavy-lidded eyes, a secret smile on her face, as she remembered her youth.""This particular quote in context implies that Hakon should just go ahead and rape Anora, because he's so good looking and rich and a spectacular lover, the rape will be null and void because the wench in question will love it.Yeah...this is just a horrible impression for a romance novel...and towards the 'good guy' especially.Again, I believe another reviewer also noticed the abundance of Gwendolyn's stupidity. Keep getting in trouble by walking around alone? Just keep doing it! Yeah! Not only is it a poor setup for danger, but it's also poor characterization. Need the heroine to come across the bad guy? Just write in there that she's walking around for funsies. Maybe she can not learn her lesson and do it again later...a few more times, at that.There was one line in an (albeit decent) scene of war: ""Acting on finely honed instincts..."" referring to Gwendolyn in fight. I literally laughed out loud. ""Finely honed"" indeed.A great line that's later in the book, after already been in danger numerous times:""Perhaps a walk would take her mind off the memories that continually plagued her. Aye, that was what she would do!""Such excitement for a walk!!! She must know that danger and excitement are ahead whenever she goes out alone! Good one, Gwennie!So why two stars instead of one? I read the whole thing and still hoped for a romantic redemption. I really wanted Hakon to be a decent guy. I really wanted true love to peek it's cute little head and yell, ""Surprise! I really AM here!"" If the story was just an outline, I would have enjoyed it better, because I really do like the premise. If only I had a trophy in poor execution...Lacking characters, lacking writing, overwrought descriptions, glorifying rape, zero hero/heroine presence...and thusly.Thank Odin it was free.",1,0,0.609993906,-0.10636529800000001,IL

2424,2424,"I absolutely loved this book. Twins, Anora and Gwendolyn, are very different in personality and spirit yet are completely identical in looks except Gwendolyn keeps her hair short. Gwendolyn is definitely a tomboy with her short hair, breeches, galloping around on horses and even trained in wweapondry. The morning Anora is due to marry Prince Wulfgar, her and Gwendolyn are kidnapped by Vikings. Gwendolyn is mistaken as a boy (Anora's brother,named Garric) while Anora steals the heart of the captain, Hakon. Gwendolyn promises her sister they she will take care of her and they will find a way to escape and even promises Anora that when threturn home Anora's maidenhead will still be intacked. From there it gets very interesting with lots of action and 'that was too close.'So, if I loved the book so much then why only 4 stars?! The author missed some very important details during the story. It's said that Gwendolyn and Anora look exactly alike except one has short hair and one has long hair but Gwendolyn is forced to cut Anora's hair as short as her own so they can switch identies. The way I see it, that should have been a dead giveaway right there. They look too much alike not to raise some eyebrows and if not that then why would Anora all of the sudden cut her long, beautiful hair to look exactly like her ""brother."" Another thing that really bugged me: after an attempted escaped, Rakon finally decides to show ""Garric"" who's boss and uses the whip on her. Not even half an hour later, Gwendolyn has changed to become Anora and ends up naked with Rakon yet there are no open wounds, scars or bruises from the whip. The servants even give Gwendolyn a bath the next morning and notices nothing. Small details forgotten in the story but they really bugged me. Other than that, I loved this story.

2425,2425,"Set aside a dose of credulity, and enjoy a romantic trip to Viking territory.  Beautiful English twins, Gwendolyn (the tomboy) and Anora (the delicate one), are kidnapped by Hakon, a Viking captain.  The twins decide their best chance of escape requires Gwendolyn to impersonate a boy.  Hakon is captivated by Anora, and he makes it clear he intends to have his way with her, but she is already betrothed.  In order to spare her more fragile sister, Gwendolyn decides to impersonate Anora, and she instructs Anora to impersonate the boy that Gwendolyn has been impersonating.  Are you confused yet?  Hang in there - it's worth it!The impersonation angle was unique and a clever way to increase the romantic tension.  It seemed unnecessary and possibly detrimental, however, (Hakon is gallant, and the sister impersonating the boy would surely have received better treatment if Hakon knew the truth) and it was just one of those things I decided to ignore so I could enjoy the story.  We know the girls will eventually be discovered, but we don't know how, and we don't know how Hakon will respond to the deception.The story was exciting, with some unexpected moments and some expected moments I could have done without, including one villain who kept popping up like Jason from Friday the Thirteenth.  These are minor issues, though, and the book is easy to recommend because there is a lot that is done well.  The most important aspect in a romance novel for me is a likable hero and heroine, and ""Twin Passions"" succeeds in that regard.

I must admit, I didn't have high expectations for the book when I downloaded it because I didn't know how the author was going to pull off this story.  Boy, was I surprised! I loved it.  I loved how both sisters balance each other out.  One sister (Gwendolyn) is strong, witty, stubborn, etc. everything I like in a female character.  What I loved about her most was her determination to keep her sister safe and protected during their kidnapping. The other sister Anora, is the very feminine sister.

Despite their differences they are unique in their own way and they don't fight for other's attention.  I was so glad that the author had made them both good.  Generally, when I read a story about twins one is good while the other is bad, and generally one tries to steal the other's man.  The author didn't do that in this story.  Because the sisters were so different in nature, it took a different man to be perfect for each sister.  My only complaint about this book was that I was a little confused about the beginning where the focus was on Anora and Wulfgar because it originally made me think that the story was about them.  After I finished the book, I realized why the author started there because Gwendolyn sole purpose was to protect her sister's virginity from Hakon and in doing that she falls in love with Hakon.

2433,2433,"The course of this book takes place shortly after the battle of Culloden a huge battle that took place in Scotland during the 1700's.  A battle that was ultimately won by the British and nobody who fought against the British king was not spared from  impisonment or death on the battlefield.  That harsh treatment of the Scots expanded into many villages as houses were looted and many were even burnt down to the ground.  Maddie is one of those that lost two people in her life, her father and the man who may have eventually become her betrothed.  Therefore her hate of the British is already really big when some troops come and ramsack her house.  But thanks to a more compassionate soldier then others, her home itself is spared.  Maddie has a caring heart and doesn't know what she's going to do as her and those in her village are going to starve as the soldiers have plundered them of food and supplies.Garrett is a British soldier assigned a position near Maddie's village, because of his Scottish background.  His grandmother had come from some of the Scotts who ultimately fought on the side of the British, but he's looked at as a last resort to see if he can capture a notorious outlaw Black Jack who with a band of five others, have managed to steal supplies from the British.  While one highly ranked soldier hopes to end things peacefully if at all possible, another Hawley ones to continue to administer the harsh treatment they've reigned down on the Highlanders so far.  Not wanting any more bloodshed if at all possible, Garret is their last hope of bringing the situation to a peaceful conclusion.  The suggestion is made that he try to woo one of the village women in the hopes that maybe he can either earn her trust or possibly learn something while she's in the throes of passion.But Garret't assignment gets off to a rocky start as he and his men end up being victims of Black Jack themselves, but he arrives in the village a few days later.  He promptly moves some of his men into Maddie's house at Farraline.  He's immediately attracted to the spirited on the woman on the spot while she's filled with nothing but hatred but also fear as it turns out she's the legendary Black Jack that Garrett has been assigned to find.  Although it makes her mission more dangerous with a bunch of British soldiers on her property, Maddie is determined to continue on with her raids until she and her villagers have enough food to feed them through the upcoming winter.  A plan that she is able to carry out thanks to a hidden tunnel beneath the house that takes her safely about 40 yards away from the edge of her property.Some complications arise thanks to Hawley's eagerness and lack of patience in capturing the legendary Black Jack.  What does this mean for Maddie and the fellow band of villagers that go with her on these raids.  And how does her growing attraction for Garrett possibly jeopardize the trust she's earned from the rest of the villagers who are grateful for everything she's done for them?  Can she trust Garrett if she decides to give herself up in order to spare the rest of the village?  And does she risk losing the man forever when she stubbornly tries to deny the building passion she feels for Garrett?Miriam Minger rights really good historical romances with some very spirited women and this book was no exception as Maddie was very passionate about her people and their cause.  But it's that same passion and stubborness that almost causes her and her people to lose even more then they already have.  Will she learn from her mistakes before it's too late?I've bought and read other Miriam Minger novels and as I've enjoyed the ones I've read so far I'll continue to purchase more of her books in the future.

She needs Adams help to keep her newly acquired plantation running, so she agrees, to his face, to marry him, while secretly planning to break the betrothal after she picks someone worthy, who can then take over management of the plantation.  He begrudgingly agrees to keep it secret, so she can enjoy a little romantic, secret, suspense.

If you enjoy the plot of this book, do yourself a favor and check out Twin Passions.Defiant Impostor opens with these words from an English father to his twelve-year-old daughter, Susanna: ""Yer late, ye little b*tch!"" before he takes a swing at her.  Her father regularly abuses her and forces her to beg on the streets for money.  As she is approaching puberty, he makes it clear he intends to pimp her, and in fact, he's already selected a repugnant ""john"".  A fortuitous and well-timed accident with a carriage kills Susanna's father and puts her in the care of wealthy Lady Redmayne and her young niece, Camille Clary.  Camille's father owns a plantation in Virginia, and he sent Camille at the age of three to England for her education.  While Susanna recovers, Lady Redmayne offers to hire her as the maid to Camille.  Susanna eagerly accepts, and the two young girls become best friends, despite their difference in status.Seven years later, Camille's father dies, and the two young women set sail for Virginia so Camille can take her place as lady of the plantation.  She becomes fatally ill during the voyage, and she begs Susanna to impersonate her should she die, as she does not want the plantation to fall into her aunt's hands.Susanna must now learn to navigate the upper class world she has only viewed as an outsider.  She is also determined to find a suitably wealthy husband, even as she's courted by handsome Adam, the plantation manager.  Susanna is attracted to Adam, but she considers this hired hand beneath her newly (and falsely) acquired status.  Adam has his own secrets and his own reasons for pursuing ""Camille"" that have nothing to do with love, although it's clear that won't be the case for long.  We know Susanna won't be able to maintain her deception forever, but the author deftly manages the suspense of how and when she will discovered.The author handles everything in this story wonderfully - the romance, the sex, the suspense, and the depictions of the lives of masters and their servants.

2450,2450,"I was not fond of the way the story was told. Like I was on the outside looking in. The reader gets told how each character feels. It got tedious for me. The first half of the story wasnt that bad, but somewhere around the 50% mark it started to get really bizzare.Plot: Basically this is a story about 2 people who are wildly attracted to each other each with their own hang ups. She has a fiance out of state whom she ""thinks she will grow to love in time."" He has a dead fiancee and a sister that dies mid story.  The title made me think I might get porn, while the cover art suggested romance so I gave it a try. The writing- with its God references peppered through out- made me think this might be an ""undercover"" Christian book. You know the kind where the author is out to prove that a story can be secular, but still clean enough for the prude reader? It wasnt.Characters: Trevor is a 25 year old fashion designer and he's not gay? Panzina is 21 with the life experience of a thirty year old. She has raised her fiances 4 year old son since birth- despite the fact that said fiance seems pretty absent. And when she gives up the son to the biological mother- there is no sadness or loss beyond one paragraph. And if the story is chronological- she doesnt see the son more than once in 6 months after giving him up.I know absolutely nothing about the author, but I am inclined to say that Patterson is quite a few decades past 21 and 25. Her characters have experiences and world views far beyond the typical 20 something. Also her 25 year old millionaire came from a very poor family- he made his fortune pretty fast and he's still pretty grounded. Normally- he would still be in the drugs, alcohol, and models stage if he was a real guy.Writing: there are times when I thought Patterson's first language wasnt english. There were several phrases that no young person would say, we arent raised to be stilted and formal. Ex) ""What do you have a taste for?""Her writing is flowery and over the top at times; ""It meant that he desired her company, craved it more than the delicious sushi, which he described."" Or ""She was such a passionate woman that incidents like this could permanently mark her heart."" Or ""his eyes appraised her figure with admiration."" Patterson tells us how her characters feel constantly using the most creative language she can find: ""She felt dreary as she walked up the front steps"" and ""her emotions churned in turmoil.""What I mean by bizzare: Panzina is engaged, yet she hardly thinks about Telvin. She has no problems holding hands, kissing and fondling Trevor, yet she plans on being a virgin on her wedding night. Yeah, Patterson over plays the pure, good girl thing. Then in a really weird twist, she gives herself as balm when Trevor's sister dies and her needs ""comfort"" saying, ""She forgot about her fears, reservations and promises made. Trevor had been there for her when she neeeded someone desperately. It was only right to be there for him in his time of need. She wouldnt be a virgin on her wedding night, but at least her first time would be with a man whom she truly loved.""Also- Patterson couldnt keep track of her own world. Trevor's ""penthouse"" has a driveway, patio, and full sized pool. Characters can walk up to the door. Forgive me, but I have always been taught that the penthouse is the top of a highrise or appartment building. And Trevor hates coffee yet he orders it. How do I know he hates coffee? Because Patterson has her characters have a several paragraph conversation about how he wont drink it because it tastes like dirt.But the icing on the cake of bizarre for me is when Panzina has the epiphany, ""Trevor might like me if I finally break off my engagement."" Yeah, she was a total ditz. I have zero respect for Panzina. She was the kind of woman that I ridicule on a regular basis.Would I recommend it: No, not unless you are super into drama and soap opera style characters are your thing.

The book description will tell you what you need to know about the actual story, but I want to tell you about the writing. This is the first time that I've read any of this authors work and I was thoroughly impressed with the lyrical feel of her words. It is what I look for in a good book. When I began to read her poetic words, I instantly settled down for a good journey, getting comfortable and sinking into that place where you know that you can get lost into a 'deep' story. That only happens for me when I can enjoy the words every bit as much as I can enjoy the unfolding story.When I had to put the book down for such mundane purposes as going to work, getting off the bus etc. the characters stayed alive in my mind as I wondered what was going to happen next. Once their tale ended I wanted more, but not because the ending wasn't satisfying, but because it was just that good. This isn't a long story--but that's not to be confused with a 'rushed story'. This author has taken the time to write descriptively instead of with instant gratification so that she can just get to 'wham bam thank you ma'ame'.

Certainly she would have had chores, yet she always seems able to make time to go and goof off in town or read and sleep.

2467,2467,"~~From Red Adept Reviews~~I received Anomaly, by Thea Atkinson, as a review copy submitted to ""Red Adept Reviews"" by the author.Overall: 3 3/4 StarsPlot/Storyline: 3 1/2 StarsThough the cover art [at the time of this review] evokes paranormal romance and the title rings of science fiction, this book is all about sex and drugs and gender-switching, oh my!Anomaly was consistent on its engaging themes, but while several subplots were tied up satisfactorily, the main plot read more like a ""day in the life"" story. J's POV was a marvelously different take on the world, and very engaging, but I wouldn't go anywhere near ""psychological thriller.""The pacing was great; it only lagged once, when a new character was introduced during a tense scene, and some of the tension leaked out as they spent several pages shooting the breeze.Despite all the drugs and the addicts who crave them in this story, it's not a tale of freewheeling partying. J is a recovering addict who manages to get two other characters into rehab. It was fascinating to see how this affected the plot: J has to take over another character's problem for her, eventually leading to a twist at the conclusion.J's actions to bring on the book's conclusion had no explanation. His sudden choice feels random and suicidal. Suicidal tendencies have a place in the novel--they're an issue he's struggled with before, and one that becomes particularly topical after a surprise medical diagnosis--but his deliberate choice to attract harm felt out of character and confused the stated reason for J's scar collection.The book's ending was anti-climactic for me. Considering how the book opened, I assumed from the start that J had always believed what he only seemed to discover at the end.Character Development: 5 StarsJ was well-crafted. Through his eyes, I truly grasped the difference between sex and gender, the pain that not being able to conform to society's one-gender expectations can bring, and how easily such pain can drive those on the fringes of ""normalcy"" to seek chemical happiness or oblivion.Reading about Molly was a hoot. She seemed full of contradictions and uncaring that she sometimes didn't make any sense. Her compassionate nature warred companionably with her mission to prove that all women were secret lesbians.Sherona was very believable as she went from offended to compassionate to loving. Stephanie's dedication to her baby's health and happiness made a beautiful contrast to her crippling addiction. Even J's mother brought excellent tension to every one of her scenes through her hopes for her son's happiness and the censorious ways she expressed them.Writing Style: 4 StarsWritten in first person, Ms. Atkinson's novel takes its sweet time with description in all the right places, enhancing everything from the pain of J's injuries to the way his body reacts with need for the drugs he used to take as they show up in his life again. The level of detail makes it impossible not to identify with J at least on a physical level, as a human being, and that in itself goes a long way toward making his perspectives and experiences ring true, even to someone who's only ever had one gender.It was distracting to me that the author included so many product names in this novel; it's got more product placement than The Truman Show. Misspelling ""Pepto Bismal"" probably won't land that sponsorship deal, though.I did notice a handful of small inaccuracies, like calling the muscle on the back of the upper arm a bicep instead of the triceps, and cheekbones having flesh instead of marrow.Editing: 2 StarsOh, dear. Such a crystal sea of good storytelling, obscured by massive algae mats of typos and punctuation errors. There's a dearth of proper comma usage, especially in dialogue, which gave me the sensation that the robotic Kindle TTS voice was beaming the story straight into my head. Hyphens were also a large issue in this story--or rather, their absence was, leaving me curious about the difference between plain and fancy ""ass business cards"", and myriad less-amusing issues. Homophone switching and simple typos appeared regularly as well.For a book that contained a purposeful Christian-religion theme, I found too many related or derived words with incorrect capitalization (bible, beJesus, hell).

However, one must remember that hired killers and those who hire them are not usually good, law-abiding, clean-talking, upstanding, citizens.

2486,2486,"It's always a pleasure to read a romance where the hero is head-over-heels in love with the heroine and pursuing her with determination.  It seems like there are so many regency romances where the hero is damaged in some way and sworn off marriage or the heroine is not up to snuff for some reason and he has to be convinced that he can't live without her.Simon knows immediately that Cassandra intrigues him.  He insults her the first time they meet, but he later explains he assumed she was a lady and he expected to be rebuffed by his rude proposition.  As he gets to know her, Simon becomes determined to marry her, but he does a bad job of making his honorable intentions clear to Cassandra. He tells his sister, his friend Harry and even asks her grandfather permission to address her, but Cassandra is in the dark.  This, on top of pressure from Cassandra's grandfather leads to the big misunderstanding towards the end of the book, which is cleared up fairly quickly.In addition to the romance between Cassandra and Simon, Cassandra has a whole other storyline going on. She discovers very early in the book that her parents are not her biological family and her grandfather is an Earl.  He wants to claim her as his family and has plans for her.  This plot is very nicely interwoven with her romance with Simon.I've read this book several times and have read all four books in the series.  It's interesting that another reviewer said her favorites were books 1 & 3, because my favorites were books 2 & 4.  I'll admit I tend to like regency stories that include wealthy ""Cits"" (merchant class characters), but also I appreciate the sincerity of the heroes in both books.  Simon's sister gives him some great advice in this book and he follows it closely since he'll do anything to win Cassandra's heart.

2487,2487,"I had high hopes from the blurb - a unique and intriguing premise - and the story started out great. Unfortunately, the initial drama was over much too soon, and suddenly we're thrown forward eight years and the characters have changed completely.If I'm reading a ""reformed rake"" story, I want to SEE ""Lord Wicked"" change over time and EARN his redemption. Telling the reader ""it's eight years later and he's really really sorry"" just doesn't cut it. We miss out completely on the restless, conflicted wickedness and get him tirelessly patient, self-sacrificial and boring.Likewise, I would have been much more likely to have compassion and respect for the heroine if I could have SEEN the consequences of the initial drama. Instead, we leave Jillian as a 17-year-old caught up in the aftermath of a scandalous duel and never really understand what turned her into a rude, self-centered bitch. She refuses to acknowledge her own behavior in the fiasco and blames everyone else around her.I know the author was trying for an ""independent and feisty"" heroine, but Jillian veered off that narrow path straight into ""obnoxious and unlikeable.""A reformed rake needs someone worth reforming for, and Jillian - at least in the first part of the book - definitely isn't it.

I found the writing and storyline average; nothing to really complain about but nothing especially interesting in the writing style. The plot line was predictable. The main characters had some depth but many of the supporting characters were homogenous. The choice of setting seemed more for the titillation factor than for the historical relevance.The focus was on the main character's sexual frustrations and strained relationship with his father. I mainly kept reading to find out how long the kid would put up with his father's abuse. Billing this as historical, though, is a disservice to readers who expect history interwoven in the story.

The heroine was really annoying, acting like an unemotional bad-a** with her own self-serving agenda at times, and then at other times, she was an emotional wreck who seemed intent on playing the victim.  I found nothing respectable about her. The relationship the heroine had with her FBI partner was weird...was he secretly bisexual? The hero, who the author tried to depict as an alpha male was anything but to me.  The sexual tension between him and the heroine was so drawn out yet he continues to go out with other women to appease his mom when he supposedly has the hots for the heroine.  Nothing alpha male to me there! Also, I wasn't convinced of love after two sex sessions (which, by the way, were so uninspiring they should have been left out of the book).

I googled the Scottish vampire myth and yeah, it's a real myth, and it's portrayed fairly accurately and might make an okay monster movie, but I expected more archeology and less cryptozoology. The author spends way too much time developing the various vampire types and the characters fade away into the bloodbath of the (often rididulous) action. I can suspend disbelief as well as most readers who like authors like James Rollins but this was just silly. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot, and dozing off occasionally.

I also liked the author's obvious love of words - the word definitions that headed chapters (which was in character for Claire) and the letters to Virginia Woolf were both great touches.

Seriously it is an attention grabber from the get go.Rainy is just like any of us girls. Did what was expected of her and now that she did her obligation to go to school, graduate and have a stable paying job. A logical next step was to get married. We see her meet her prospective husband and in-laws, we watch her doubts over the match develop. We see her fight a system in futile, and watch her heart broken. She will grow strong under fire and triumph in the end.At first I had a doubt I would loved the young main character but as I watch and cheer her as she reach for her dreams I feel myself dreaming with her. I watch her disappointment when those dreams turned out to be nightmare and my heart broke with her as she struggles with vulnerability, uncertainties, fear, and make mistakes. In short I was drawn into the story as I watch the main character grow a steel backbone with a beating loving heart to forge the steel.I love the characters, they are alive to me even the secondary characters are not left in the shadow. I love the pacing of the story, it's not dragged and I love that no issues were dragged as well just make a part of the story stick. It made me admire the author and believe in her craft. I love that the less popular issues tackled on the story are done without putting the other side of the argument in a bad light - like commitment and marriage or the lack thereof.I love the book, I recommend it, and I am keeping it.",1,1,0.561253561,0.561253561,PA
2497,2497,"Where do I begin? A quick overview. Basically, the USA is sick of divorces. The government was embarrassed so if you want to get married you need to fill out a questionnaire from the government and they'll pick your match. Rainy, does just that. She's at a point in her life where she's graduated, has a decent job, now she just wants someone to share her time with. Her father is a State Representative so in order to not embarrass him she fills out the questionnaire. Ashely Schroeder, the heir to a major appliance corporation does just the same and is paired with Rainy. You can probably figure out it doesn't go exactly as planned.I'll try to keep spoilers out of this but it may be difficult. I'd like to warn you that I'm about to throw a little spoiler out. Rainy, accuses Ashley of being an alcoholic and yet, hello? Maybe she should take a good look at herself! She got wasted the first night she met Ashley and his family. Talk about the pot calling the kettle? Also, why would she file an appeal without speaking to Ashley. When she finds out he's already filed for one she goes ballistic. So it's ok for her but not him? Then she proceeds to ignore him and all of his calls and correspondence for two months. Pot and kettle, my friend.I'm not sure I enjoyed this. I thought it was a bit too drawn out. I thought Rainy was a bit rude in some situations. When her and Ashley met for counseling she was terrible to him. I was cringing. Ok, obviously, their match wasn't perfect but she signed up for it the same as him. It's kind of a 50/50. Yeah his mom was terrible, yeah they didn't exactly have the same views on what a marriage was all about, yeah the government got it wrong but at least Ashley tried to suck it up and tried to be nice to her.I think that this could have been a little better. I feel there were some things that were just thrown in for length. Like when she was putting around her museum. We pretty much could have skipped most of that. I didn't hate this book, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone either.  It had a lot of good ideas but I also felt a lot of contradictions as well. Especially, with Rainy's family.

2498,2498,"It's fascinating to watch the wild swings in the reviews of this book, everything from moralizing about the institution of marriage to delight in the heroine's wittiness and then back to dismay with Ms. Gean's writing ability. Any writer who stirs things up that much must be worth some attention.Let's cut Ms. Gean some slack here. This is her first novel, and given that, she moves things along fairly well with a combination of witty insights and satirical situations. Since I'm an older guy, I would not normally read anything presented to me as chick-lit or romance, but I found this effort engaging.If you liked the movie TiMER, you'll probably like this story. Both use as their starting premise a world in which personal judgment is replaced by overarching systems and technology. In the case of this book, it's the Department of Marriage that issues matches which everyone must agree to if they want to marry. The plot, of course, unwinds this premise as the heroine Rainy discovers that she detests her ""dream"" match and hooks up instead with his brother. As with TiMER, romance and personal instinct win out over systems.Some of the critiques that I've read do not seem to grasp the satirical nature of the writing. Satires involve exaggerations and outlandishness. The characters aren't supposed to be studies in depth. This isn't ""Portrait of a Lady."" A comparison to ""Gulliver's Travels"" would be more appropriate, but some of the critics here would probably dismiss Jonathan Swift as straining the bounds of credulity with silly characters and sillier situations. But that's what satirists DO!I hope Ms. Gean keeps at this. I see a lot of sparks here. Some pretty good blazes must surely follow.",1,1,0.647590361,0.679627601,PA

I read the first few paragraphs of several books, looking for something that would engage my sleep-deprived self and wasn't so 'deep' or 'dry' that I had to put all of my concentration into reading.  When the first few pages of the book yielded mentions of both massively-multiplayer online role-play gaming and Surprise, Arizona, I knew I had a winner.  And I was not disappointed.While the plot yielded few surprises, I can't fault Ms. Bennett for that; this book wasn't meant to be 'suspense' or 'mystery' after all.  Instead it was a fun, engaging look at a life turned upside-down and the main character's attempts to right it again.  There is a wide array of characters present, all of them believable and interesting.  The first-person narrative is easy to read without being simplistic, and there are a lot of laugh out loud moments throughout the book.Circle City Blues is, simply put, one of the very best romance-slanted indie books I've read.

They aren't super-heroes - they do everyday things and have everyday problems in their lives and THAT is why this book is so great.  The main character could be your brother or your son.  He's a good guy who gets a bad deal and tries to get through it as unscathed as possible.  He reminded me of my own brother in many ways.  I felt an immediate kinship with him and many others in this charming story of love and loss.Mrs. Wells is definitely one of those authors who is going to explode off the scene one day.

You have to read the second book, third book and the first book is actually the last. I was half way through the first book when I realized it wasn't in order.These books have it all vamps, shifters of all kinds, demons, humans that know of their existance and some that are just blind to all that takes place in the world around them. She makes you fall in love with all the characters and they are in every book, but each book they hunters for Night Watch find their mate, the one they can't live without. It sucks you in and you don't want to put it down. In between saving the world from the Others that are killers they fall in love and the sex seens are great. Eden knew just how to have all the action, love and sex in the right spots. All the males are sexy, strong Alphas that are determined to save the one they fall hard for and the females they fall for can defianlty hold their own. They are strong heroins that don't take crap from anyone even the men they are falling for. It is amazing and I would recommend to anyone who likes these type of books.1st book the main characters: Jude a weretiger and bounty hunter who is suppose to protect the ADA, Erin from a stalker.

Her stalker kills anyone that upsets her and Jude isn't liking it. The stalker claims to be her mate and even though deep down Erin doesn't think he is she isn't 100 percent sure that he isn't right. Jude hasn't told Erin but he feels he is her mate not the sick stalker that is after her.2nd book the main character is Dee a bounty hunter and her favorite thing to hunt are killer vamps. She works with Zane a demon but also a bounty hunter a lot. She meets Simon one night when she is hunting and he saves her ass from being shot. What she doesn't realize is he is a vamp and she falls into bed with him. Simon wants Dee to trust him and he sticks to by her every time she is out hunting and has her back. She gets attack and dies in his arms but he knows something she doesn't Dee is a born vamp and she will rise again soon. Now Dee is the one thing she hates most a vamp and she thinks Simon did this to her, but when she goes to comfront him and he is trying to explain instead of trying to kill him lust takes over. They end up in bed again and she bites him and sees everything. Someone is trying to kill them and they have to fight or die. Zane is Dee's close friend and Simon is jealous of him but learns fast that she trust him and its friends only for them.3rd book Zane is back and hunting hard for the evil that is in his town. He enjoys the hunt and has know idea that he is going to find one bounty that he just can't turn over.

2526,2526,"Having already read another of this author's books, I picked ""Crystal Cowboy"" expectant. And yes, disappointed I was NOT!This story gripped me from the very beginning, with its lovely main characters, Harp and Goldie, mother and son who are friends  and partners more than anything else. The journey to a local rodeo contest turns into a long gripping adventure for both of them, and for quite a few others, their friends and partners and even their antagonists. Like it so very often happens in a real life, they got into all sorts of unexpected adventures the modern day cowboys, apparently, know how to deal with, finding love and more friends along the way.I kept turning pages (virtually so, as I'm very fond of my Kindle), enjoying the journey alongside with them, surprised at the many unexpected turns. The story rolls on smoothly, pleasantly, wonderfully consistent, enjoyable and light despite its unarguable depth. The characters are growing, changing along the way, but subtly so, the way it happens in the real life, usually through mundane, non-dramatic events.I grew very fond of this author's style and I'm planning to read as many of his works as I can lay my hands on, having a few more of his books on my Kindle already.A highly recommended 5 stars read!",1,1,0.647058824,0.470588236,PA

2528,2528,"The 10 Keys to Happy and Loving Relationships opens with definitions of the types of love - eros, phileo and agape. This is foundational in understanding how to love our neighbour, ourselves and especially our enemies.Each chapter starts with Love is... and loosely follows the ""love chapter"" (1 Corinthians 13) from the Bible that we have become familiar with hearing at most wedding ceremonies: ""Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.""Each chapter ends with affirmations and questions for further thought and action, along with quotable quotes.Jesus said that the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God, followed by love your neighbour as yourself. (Matthew 22; 36-39) This small book gives tools to communicate such love and fulfill this commandment.I recommend this little ebook as a wonderful tool to help apply Biblical truths about love in our relationships.",1,1,0.6367713,0.81838565,PA

The book has one chapter for each of ten top attributes of love. After each chapter the reader is stimulated to take it personal with helpful questions to reflect on and also empowering thoughts and affirmations.I loved the first chapter where Kuehn points out that in order to have love for others we have to first begin with loving and accepting ourselves. She concludes by giving us very practical tips for ""practicing"" love. She so wisely states that ""Love is the greatest of all gifts. There is nothing else that can transform our lives and relationships the way love can.""I highly recommend this little book.

2541,2541,"The year is 1914.  Rose Courtenay is an eighteen year old girl, who in keeping with her upper-class upbringing, is expected to do no more than marry a man of similar social standing, who will be able to `form her opinions for her'.  With aspirations to go to university, it is clear that Rose has valid opinions of her own.  It is also apparent that, though she thinks Michael Easton, the man chosen as suitable by her parents, is handsome, Rose does not feel the same flutter of excitement she experiences in the presence of Alex Denham, a most unsuitable, sullen man: the fruit of his mother's scandalous affair and who has no social standing.  Denying her attraction and stifled by her dull existence, Rose runs away, determined to do more with her life than be a good wife. Thus, we follow Rose's progress as she volunteers at a hospital - something she is ill-equipped for, finally to end up a dedicated and proficient nurse seconded to the front line.  Her flaw, of course, is that she did not consider the devastation she would cause her parents, disappearing without a trace.Meanwhile, in the muddy, lice-infested pits that serve as trenches, Alex and Michael are fighting side-by-side to defend that front line.  Alex is Michael's superior and though Michael is a gentleman he is not a noble man.  Alex, on the other hand, has many heroic qualities; embarking on an affair with Rose while married to another woman perhaps not being one of them, unless, of course, one pauses to consider why he would immediately offer to marry a woman he didn't love, who claimed to be carrying his child.  Because of the stigma he carried as a child born out of wedlock possibly?What makes The Silver Locket outstanding, for me, is the excellent portrayal of what life might have been like for those poor souls in the trenches and for the medical staff that fought tirelessly to care for them when their bodies and spirits were broken.  The author obviously put a tremendous amount of historical research into the writing of this book, and managed to relay it - seamlessly - in a way that was compelling, accurate and thought-provoking.

I had recently re-read 'Jane Eyre' and seen a recent film based on the book, and was pondering just how Jane and Mr. Rochester had managed to work out their differences and make a life together.  Jane was a fearless girl in her own way, and this story continues to present her with adventures and challenges to test her growing sense of maturity and new role as a wife and lover.  Jane is a product of a society in which women were kept in the dark regarding sexual matters, and the author, Kimberly Bennett, knew that Jane would need to brought forward gently in her responses to her husband's desires. Sexuality, its expression and repression, was a central theme in Bronte's book, and it continues to be a central focus in Bennett's book.  Jane continues to be the thoughtful, intelligent, and introspective woman she was before, but now she has much more to think about, and a husband to nuture, heal and enjoy.  I enjoyed seeing her grow into her natural scope, and to learning that even Mr. Rochester could be charming, even yearning.

2568,2568,"I really had a lot of hope for this book.  I felt the author did a good job carrying on the tone of the original Jane Eyre - even though sometimes her use of archaic language seemed a little clunky.  I was disappointed that the first half was centered around Jane's preocupations with their sex life.  Their encounters are described discreetly, but. . . Really?  Things may have improved in the second half, but I sensed they were probably going to get steamier so I chose not to finish.",1,0,0.663265306,0.0,PA
2569,2569,"I couldn't even come anywhere close to finishing this book it is so bad.  I'm a huge Jane Eyre fan and was looking forward to reading this. What a disappointment.I felt a premonition at the very first sentence of the preface: ""Dear Reader, do you remember me?"" Then came a recital of the events in Jane Eyre. One of the most famous novels in the world doesn't need a recap. The fact that the author almost injures herself trying to imitate the tone of the novel doesn't help. And it is painful to read it is so awkward.It quickly becomes clear that the Jane in this sequel has a very low opinion of Mr. Rochester and an inflated opinion of herself: ""I was pleased to see my generous nature was influencing my companion's tendency towards pettiness, and the marriage ceremony only ten minutes old!""She gets mean on their wedding night, blowing hot and cold for no reason. Then, after 4 months of marriage she becomes a resentful shrew who feels that her husband is selfish and though she has gone out of her way to serve him without his asking her to be a slave (she even tastes his cherries before he does to make sure they're not too tart!) feels put upon, feels that he has nervous fancies and is ""not cruel, but merely conjectured my service to him was a pleasure."" Then she gets ticked off if he takes any time away from her. Sheesh.Finally after treating the poor man to a series of mood swings and pettiness (she's even upset that marriage doesn't improve England's climate for her) that cause him to withdraw she says: ""What his struggle was that took his attention from me I could not ascertain by a survey of his pagan mien.""!!!That's it. 12% into the book and I couldn't take this crap anymore.

The author allowed you to believe that characters with the same names were all very similar in appearance, with very similar relationships to each other, and although this wasn't a problem, it would have been nice to have a little variety thrown in there. They were however, well written and did manage to have slightly different character quirks between the times.In general, the rest of the writing was good and there were some good dramatic elements thrown into what was essentially a very considered plot.Picky things aside, I was pleasantly surprised by the whole thing and was very pleased with the ending, despite the fact an obvious alternative would have been just as good.Well done Tammie Clarke Gibbs.

Ms. Gibbs addressed this and it made the story more appealing to me. I won't spoil it, but I loved the ending.

2594,2594,"I enjoyed this sequel to RAELIKSEN, though I didn't think it was quite as good as that first one.At the end of RAELIKSEN, Mara (the Connacht princess and wife of the Northman, Raeliksen), was left a pregnant widow. Not exactly the happy ending you might have been seeking, I know. Now, seven years later, Mara is raising Daegan's son alone, and the man she thinks is her father, the king, is dying. Breandan Mac Liam, the Irish hunter who loved her in book one, is sent by the dying king to retrieve his daughter. For seven long years, Breandan has loved Mara, dreaming of her every night and unable to love any other woman. Now he will be with her once again.I loved Breandan...he was consistently honorable, strong, wise and unafraid of the obstacles to his loving Mara. But what happened to Mara in this sequel? She seemed weaker and more tossed about by events than in the first one where I thought she was a bit stronger. I thought her continued vow of love for her dead husband, Daegan, somewhat distracted from the main love story. And it just brought back the pain of the first book's ending. I imagine the author wants to show you can love two people at the same time (one dead) but it came across a bit disappointing to me. And Breandan's being ok with her loving Daegan was a bit too understanding. After all, it had been 7 years. I liked the side story of Gustaf and AEsa, and their story is coming up in 2012!Some places the story lagged to my mind, though the battle toward the end was quite good. The aftermath was a bit bizarre. Mara, though an Irish princess, was treated like just another person for the whole story, except at the end when the people were suddenly bowing down to her, even Breandan. That was kind of strange.For those of you, like me, who were left hanging at the end of RAELIKSEN, and want the rest of the story, this is a must read.",1,1,0.6237623760000001,0.606660666,PA
2595,2595,"Holy son of a Monkey's Uncle. This book has everything that you could ever want in a novel. There are shifters, vamps, demons, inter-dimensional travel, a rotating love triangle, and the real life of a university student complete with trials, tribulations, and parties. Yes, this book is about werewolves and vampires, but that is where the similarity to most other books of the genre ends. Lyon takes this basic premise and runs far and fast with it, giving her audience a novel that cannot be put down.Lyon manages to work in little bits of background information throughout the story, giving her readers the pertinent information when necessary. This means that there is no long, drawn out lull where all background information is given. This is masterfully done. She also uses vivid descriptions and backgrounds to set up her story without being long winded or confusing. Even the town names are fittingly symbolic.And let's not forget the cast of characters that we meet in this novel. They are very well developed and suit their lives perfectly. Their interactions with each other are uniquely realistic as well. One moment you are seeing the cattiness of social cliques colliding, followed the next by true friendships, and then again by budding romantic relationships. They are the type of people that you would want to live with in real life.When pulled all together Lyon`s novel is written in a way that YA and adult readers alike can enjoy. She never once talks down to her audience, nor does she assume that we, as readers, will piece together backgrounds that are not provided.

2596,2596,"I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.Overall I absolutely loved this book and would have instantly rated it five stars if not for a few things that really disturbed me and unfortunately made it hard to completely enjoy.  With that being said I will try to highlight the pros and cons and let you decide for yourself.I am going to start with what I didn't like since it is a small list...actually it is only one thing and that is the sexuality.  There are two fairly brutal scenes where a man tries to rape the main character, Sophie.  I get that the author wanted to show that this man is brutal and takes what he wants, but I feel it definitely could be done in another way.  Aside from that there is a lot of sexuality between Sophie and her boyfriend Sebastian.  You probably think that I am old fashioned, and maybe I am, but I do not believe that sex should have any place in YA books.  This book is promoted as being for ages 14+ and I definitely think that these scenes are way to intense for readers that young.  That being said, this was my only problem with this book.  Other than this the book is amazingly wonderful!The story line is a new twist to the YA paranormal romance.  Sophie is a typical teen with a boring life.  She is getting ready to go away to college with her best friend Beth, and hoping that it will change her life.  Just before leaving she is bitten by a fox and this bite sets off a series of strange events.  Life just keeps getting stranger once Sophie arrives in her new town and starts college.  She meets some very strange characters and gets sucked in to a strange world that she never knew existed.The characters in this book are all well written.  The bad guys are written in such a way that they are unnerving and seem to ooze evil.  They are cruel and ruthless and will stop at nothing to destroy Sophie and her friends.  Then there are the good guys.  Sebastian, Sophie's amazing boyfriend,  and his family are quite an eclectic group of people and they all have great stories of their own.  My favorite character of all was Conner, Sebastian's cousin.  I love to root for a good underdog character and he is an amazing one.  He has had a rough childhood and has always been in the shadow of Sebastian.  When he is first introduced he is socially awkward and very quiet.  He finds himself falling for Sophie and I can't help but to want them to end up together, despite her relationship with Sebastian.  Sebastian is nice enough but Connor is so endearing I can't help but root for him.The ending is also a great cliff hanger.  Sebastian, Sophie and his family are hot on the trail of THE bad guy and just as it looks like they are going to get him he disappears in to a portal to his dimension.  Now they have to decide if they are capable of following him and fighting him on his home turf.  I can't wait to see how it all ends!",1,1,0.558573854,0.676287493,PA
2597,2597,"Does anyone have any idea how hard it is to find any information on this book. . .No seriously the goodreads page is so outdated with hardly any information on the book on it. Plus the second book isn't even up on goodreads, just this one and the original look for this book. I came across this book back in December when I was trying to spend my giftcard on Kobo, so I went looking for books. Seeing this and thinking ""Wow...a book with a fox bite"" I had to read it. Now I read it and I'm so glad that I did. It was so great, I loved everything about this book and the only issues I had are really minor.The characters are so well placed in the book, Sophie at first is really shy and liked to keep to herself. She only wants to focus on her study's more then anything else. That's why her friend Beth is there to help her come out to clubs to party even when she doesn't want to. She soon loosens up when she meets Sebastian changing her in a lot of ways. He opens a life she never knew about full of love and heartbreak. Beth her best friend is a selfish person who doesn't have feelings at all and only cares about herself. . . No really that's what I think of Beth. She annoys me with saying me things to Sophie not really caring about her feelings but Sophie doesn't see this, she only see's a friend. Sebastian is a hot sexy boy with blond hair and turns into a werewolf on a fullmoon without control. Even though the werewolf he turns into is something I really don't like (meaning the more human the animal version of a werewolf) I still like the fact that they transform either way. He is a smooth talker and loves Sophie but he also loves his job so that comes into conflict a lot with the two of them. He's fun to be around and knows how to talk to girls, Sophie is his first real girlfriend so he's learning how the whole girlfriend/boyfriend thing works.  Towards the ending of the book though I find that he really doesn't care much about Sophie, which is so annoying because Sophie, even though she tells him he doesn't listen. Then there is Connor, oh he's such a cutie boy, though he doesn't know how to talk to Sophie you can see that he likes her and even tries to put the moves on her a few times. He is Sebastian's cousin and also a werewolf, where Sebastian lacks in caring for Sophie Connor is there to pick up the slack. He cares so much about her and wouldn't let anything happen to her even when Sebastian is gone or is there for that matter.The romance is so fast but Sophie at first tries to make it go slow which helps. Between Sebastian and her you see the chemistry between them and they can't help themselves but to make that chemistry go somewhere. So Sebastian kept being persistent and finally they're together. You can see how much Sophie loves Sebastian even though time and time again he hurts her. Later you see that her and Connor almost having the same kind of Chemistry. I do hope in the second book something happens between Sophie and Connor.As for the plot, it was great, it was new and exciting. With the use of werewolves, vampires and demons the whole story worked out right. Not to mention that the werewolves are the olden type of werewolves, not the new type. The plot is mainly focused on Sophie and her view of what's happening around her. It takes place at university in England (didn't know this till a bit later on).

2599,2599,"So, I'm only half way through the book but I thought I'd write a review now because I honestly don't know if I can finish the book. I know some people reading this review will think that it's not accurate, but I think it says a lot about the book when someone tells you that they struggled to finish it.Anyways, I think the concept of the story is cute and the characters themselves are interesting and likable, but I am really struggling with the dialogue between the characters. For some reason, it just seems awkward to me and I can't connect with the characters through what they say. Like, usually when I read books I can hear the character's voice as I read and I can hear the emotions but I can't hear that in this book. Also, some of the dialogue seems so odd to me and I just keep thinking 'do people actually talk like this?' and it makes it hard for me to keep reading because this book is dialogue heavy.Anyways, I will try to finish the book and I'll update the review when I do finish it.*EDIT*Okay, I went back and tried to read more of the book but I just can't do it any more. I'm at 55% and I can't finish.The dialogue is just killing me! The saddest thing is that I feel like this book could have been so much better if only the author broke things apart a bit but she didn't so the dialogue is just too long. There would be a whole page that is all just one person talking, with no breaks, nothing to indicate pauses, or descriptions of what the person is doing. It just makes me feel like I'm reading a weird monologue and it doesn't seem natural.It also makes it difficult, for me at least, to get a sense of what the emotions are and it makes the dialogue seem more like the characters are telling each other rather than conversing with each other. Maybe that hasn't been an issue for the other readers who reviewed but this really prevents me from getting connected with the book and the characters.So yeah, I'm very disappointed about how this reading experience turned out. The plot of the story sounded sweet and I really wanted to like it, but the dialogue prevents me from getting into the story.",1,0,0.557777778,-0.44222222200000005,PA

She doesn't seem impressed with the international singer superstar at all.  In fact, during the interview she's completely professional and maybe even a little haughty.  She's young and beautiful, but he doesn't expect that to pose a problem.  He's determined to keep their relationship strictly professional, and Summer is, too.  Neither of them  has an idea that one little girl will melt their hearts and join them together.This was a quick read with a lot of interesting characters.  Summer and Gabe take center stage, of course, but his parents and daughter are wonderful secondary characters.  They're doomed when Marisol and Gabe's mother play matchmaker.  I enjoyed watching Gabe and Summer's relationship develop. I just wish it took a bit more time; once they decide to go for it, it's full steam ahead.  The conflicts kept me reading, but once it nears the end, everything's tied up a bit too neatly.  Things won't always be wonderful, and I'd liked to have seen them weather a disaster or two to really build their relationship.  However, I'll admit it was fun reading and these two characters definitely have great chemistry.  Watching Gabe become jealous and protective was delightful.

The book became a bit confusing to me as it switched from present to past, but I finally figured out the construct and felt the book flowed freely to the end. The writing reminds me a bit of one of my other favorite modern thriller authors (Scott Nicholson), because of her absolutely beautiful use of metaphor and ability to create powerful images in the mind of the reader:""The sound that was no sound poured out of the radio. The sound of Amelia Earhart lost over the ocean, the sound of nuclear winter, the sound of the lost.

2626,2626,"Ava Delaney looks like a normal girl.  She lives in a small apartment by herself and sells stuff online.  Some would say she's a hermit.  But she would say she's avoiding humanity.  It's best for her and for everyone else.  Avoiding humans means keeping them safe.  She isn't exactly human.  She's a half breed. A species thought to be nonexistent.  Part human.  Part Vampire.  Ava has a beating heart like other humans, but the thirst of a vamp.  It's this reason that she is hiding out from humanity.  She doesn't want to be a monster.One night Ava encounters a human being toyed with by a vampire.  She doesn't want any other vampire to know she exists, since she isn't supposed to, but she isn't about to let the human die either.  By saving Carl, she unknowingly enslaves him to herself.  He is not himself anymore.  He wants to be with her constantly and ""feels"" her need for things such as blood.  He is a willing sacrifice, so to say.  She, however, is not willing to drink blood.  Since Ava can live on human food, that is what she does. She has to figure out a way to send Carl back home before she loses control.After fighting within herself, Ava calls the only person who might be able to help her: her grandmother.  They were not on the best of terms due to how her grandmother raised her.  She had tried everything to get the vampire side of Ava out of her, including exorcisms and beating.  She wanted nothing more than for Ava to be a normal girl. And after all these years, that is what Ava really wants too.  But to save Carl she is going to have to start embracing the vampire side to deal with the odds.  Now she is on the grid for two very powerful vampires at odds with each other and they both want her.  And even though she has found some help, she doesn't know exactly who she can trust.I love how Claire Farrell made a blended  human/vamp with unknown powers.  And we still don't really know all of what she can do after this first book.  We are just starting to get a glimpse at her loner-type life she is living.  She doesn't live really among the living or the dead.  She is alone.  Death and war in the vampire world is normal.  But they are two things that Ava tries her best to avoid.  Although she identifies more with the human side of her, she is forced to bring out the vamp in her to survive.  And in order for her new ""friends"" to survive as well.  Her worst fear is becoming a bloodthirsty monster.After living alone for so long, Ava doesn't trust anyone easily, and with good reason.  Between the past, and everyone after her now, how can she?  But sometimes you have to do what you really don't want to in order to protect those around you.  Ava thinks very little of her own self-preservation.  In the end, she has to make a deal with the devil.",1,1,0.574539363,0.716359575,PA

It's so hard, as a Catholic, to imagine priests, bishops, cardinals, and yes, even the Pope, experiencing this kind of problem.  Cradle Catholics who were educated by nuns in Catholic schools are pre-conditioned to believe this could never happen, as students were taught that a Priest is Christ's representative on earth.  This book is more about the man, but the fact that he is also the Pope is what brings high interest and drama into the book.  It's a story for everyone who ever had a problem with alcoholism, drugs, and just struggling with right and wrong. The writer created believable characters who I came to care so much about. A hopeful book that begins with a Pope hardly in control of his own life, let alone the life of the Catholic Church, that moves on to his life on the streets, where a recovering alcoholic, also a priest, tries to help him.

2650,2650,"OK, first of all, for anyone worried after seeing the one star review- this is not really an explicit book.  It is a coming of age book, it is about a young gay man, but it is also about rock 'n roll and guitars, and love, and people, and friends.  If you are homophobic you will HATE this book, so do not get it and give it one star.  Otherwise, give it a chance, the protagonist is a charming, loveable kid who will really charm your socks off.This story (and by that I mean the story as a whole) is slow moving.  It will appeal most to people who really appreciate good character development, get involved in the characters of the books they read, and really love an author who can create flawed characters who you still want to know.  She also includes a lot of technical information about the guitars, the music, and later on about life on the road, putting on a live show, etc.  Cool stuff.The strength, as I said, is in the character development and in the story progression.  She is also publishing this as a web serialization, and I think it works really well there because honestly it doesn't seem like things ever really resolve.  That's OK, that's kind of real life, right?  The story is the development of sexual identity of a gay man in the 80s, from denial to closeted to partially closeted to ??.  It includes his fear of exposure, the conflicts with his family, telling his friends (not all in this book- most of that comes later).  His first AIDS test.

2651,2651,"I originally ran into Daron's Guitar Chronicles as a serial and started reading... and didn't stop until I fell over two hours past my bedtime. And then I woke up the next day and did it again until I got to the end. This is probably a good summary of the story's quality.But more extensively: this is a first-person narrative set in the '80s, told by a 19-year-old musician trying to make it in the rock scene. He's got a problem family, no money, and if that wasn't enough to deal with, he's also gay. In the '80s.I have to be honest... I'm kind of over coming-of-age stories. I may at one point be excited about them again, but for now I'm really tired of the pinhole perspective of self-involved teens. But Daron's Guitar is missing that ""this universe is populated solely by teens"" feeling. Tan fills Daron's world with adults at every stage in their life, from the grizzled music veterans, the failures and the tired agents to their daughters, Daron's schoolmates and the hopefuls in the music industry. Daron observes them all; sometimes he lacks the life experience to understand them, but we know that they have a life outside Daron's limited perspective and Tan paints that very well. This world feels real: like our world, like we could run into Daron today and this will all have had happened.Not only that, but the music details are just fabulous. This is someone who really knows her stuff. I actually laughed out loud when Daron made a reference to Jon Anderson when snarking about a former roommate who was trying to get weird/experimental. If that wasn't enough, every chapter title... is an '80s song. Not just a trip down nostalgia lane for those of us who lived through them, but an impromptu soundtrack and very clever.Finally, I'm really impressed by the portrayal of Daron's relationship difficulties (such as he can be said to have them, given the circumstances). His struggle between the typical teen hormonal highs and lows and his need to have a meaningful tie with someone... it's poignant and deftly evoked. Such a great loneliness, conveyed so powerfully and yet without preaching.This is incredibly skillful writing and a compelling story.

2652,2652,"This tale was almost unrelentingly bleak. At times the bleakness receded briefly, but these were only a temporary respite. And the plot meandered a bit too realistically like the drifting life of a young person who was abused, emotionally abandoned, confused,and repressed.It was just painful to be with this broken, almost hopeless kid page after page as he moved from one set of lousy circumstances to the next. I don't have the stamina or desire to slog through a life so foundationless and so emotionally painful and bereft. In real life, there is no greater point to this kind of experience. One doesn't come out of it saying, ""Gee, I'm really glad my parents weren't fit to raise children. It taught me that ..."" or ""Aren't I lucky that my substitute family also abandoned me just before high school. It made me realize that ...""Yep, awful circumstances like here (and worse) are a daily reality for hundreds of thousands of kids in the U.S. - millions around the world.

2656,2656,"There really aren't that many authors that give us stories that manage to feel genuinely new, especially in the popular paranormal genre. Somehow Aiden James accomplishes exactly that with the Vampire's Last Lover. I'm no newcomer to the paranormal or fantasy genre, and this is coming from someone who has read a little bit of everything in this over-saturated category. The author creates characters who have no resemblance to ones from other popular series, which is a huge pet peeve of mine with vampire stories. Everything about the story is unique. My only wish was for just a little bit more 'steam', as I really enjoy the carnal nature of a vampire. This in no way hampered my enjoyment of the story though, and it was nice to see an author not have to rely on sex to make the story enticing.

2657,2657,"Started reading this as someone in feedback said that this author has been added to their fav list -- thought that sounded promising...I thought the story idea was great, an original twist on the vampire-story-bandwagon. It wasn't however executed very well. The writing didn't suck the reader in, it lagged (especially in the beginning) it wasn't pieced together well at all. The story would have you in a dramatic scene but would leave out all details as well as the end of the scene. It left the reader frustrated. Is it too much to ask for details? What did the scene feel like to the character(s) throughout the scene?? Example: Ski scene. It was bits and pieced together. Maybe it was just over-edited??The main character really irritated me. She was immature (especially around worldly and old vampires) she came off as a typical spoiled American young girl, which is okay as it's what the character was... but way overdone. She was selfish, childish, rude, had a complete inability to grasp the extreme danger of the situations she faced. She made stupid choices with little to no thought process. I find it humorous as she was picking terribly on the character Peter in the beginning about how analytical he supposedly is, yet you feel like pointing out all of her flaws. This type of thing takes a reader out of the story, you want to like the characters (good and bad) yet you end up not being interested at all here... and making the reader feel like that from the beginning.. thats not a good thing.Now for those characters.. they fell flat to me. I know they (most) are dead (according to this authors version of vampires) but they came off literally lifeless, loveless, uninteresting. I was a bit better 75% through, but then fell flat again near the end.The whole treatment of Peter, the whole ease of acceptance of her 'abduction' and the whole forced to procreate scene in front of 200 vamps was just... humph. If it had to be it should have been written better. It wasn't uncomfortable (it should have been for the characters) it just came off as ridiculous.I had hopes the whole way through for this to get better and for me it just didn't. I'm not even compelled to read the following teaser at the end. Two stars to be nice. Probably delete from my kindle.",1,0,0.588983051,0.0913371,PA

Much of the time I'll skip reviewing just because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Not this time.This book lacks character development and the protagonist (who has zero development- in fact I'd say she has negative character development as far as I am concerned- if that is even possible!) is nothing. This seems like a book written by a teenager... a young teenager, but it turns out not to be the case.There are stereotypes galore- i.e. her token black roommate named ""Tyreen"" that says ""mo fo"" a lot. I found that eye-rollingly offensive.Our leading lady- in the midst of a disaster at her college, asks if they will be renting a chalet in Gatlinburg. Her family is supposed to be from Richmond, VA and she is going to school in Tennessee. It's not a chalet down here. It's a cabin. And if serial killers/monsters are taking over your college and killing a bunch of co-eds that look like you, do you really want to go to a cabin in the woods?! Then again, our character is in the lead for the Darwin award.The protagonist, Txema (obligatory exotic name probably looked up on baby name website), is really stupid. There were how many murders in 24-48 hours and she 1) decides to meet her boyfriend after dark at the library across campus instead of him picking her up at her dorm for no apparent reason than she wants to die and 2) she decides that not only her personal safety and that of her beloved roommate is worth less than an iPad and a book. She sneaks past guards put up for the safety of those on campus. When her boyfriend's house is torn to shreds it literally doesn't cross her mind until Tyreen verbally tears her up for not calling the police.She doesn't even care to really find out what her boyfriend's fate was until he is thrust back into her life to knock her up with an audience. She's trying to figure out who she wants to sleep with with literally no regard beyond a ""I wonder if my boyfriend, best friend and her boyfriend were eaten"" (not a quote, more of a paraphrase).This story has (as mentioned before), no character development. The plot was completely disorganized and stupid.If you are looking for a Pulitzer prize winner- Don't bother.If you are looking for a great adventure/fantasy book- Don't bother.If you are looking for a decent romance book- Don't bother.If you are looking for some mindless drivel to keep you preoccupied- Don't bother.SERIOUSLY- pass on this one.",0,0,0.601532567,0.086623355,PA

Then again there are others that put a unique twist on the vampire legends which means you enjoy the story. That is what I found in Aiden James' The Vampire's Last Lover.Txema is a young college student who is like all other college students. The only difference is her unique name, her special heritage, and the birthmark on her neck. It is the birthmark that has her feeling for her life as vampires begin to appear in her life saying they want to protect her. During this time, girls that resemble her begin to die horrible deaths. What appear to be wild animals begin to hunt her and try to kill her and her boyfriend. Saying they are saving her, the vampires kidnap her and suddenly her entire life changes.As I said, this book gives an unusual twist to the vampire stories. Vampires as we know them are good. Once they go bad, they look more like werewolves that love carnage and want only death. Txema finds herself caught in a sort of civil war and she is the prize.This is a very intense book. The blood and gore is minimal though you know clearly what is happening. Intimate scenes are present but not extremely graphic. There is more focus on the plot and the people than anything else.This was a well written book. If you like vampire stories, this is a book you might want to consider.

By checking off each goal on the list, he felt like his plan was perfect and his life would be cake.Dawson, at the time, gets things in order for starting his own business in construction. In order to do this, he needs a partner, and that's where his good friend Larry comes in. As time progresses, 1989, Larry discovers he has cancer, and is given only four months to live. Dawson soon loses his best friend and business partner, Larry, and is left in a state of confusion and unfortunately, Dawson adds to the impetus of the series of tragic events b cheating on his wife, thus leading to a divorce. This first event Dawson describes as getting on a bus (life) with a different map than the driver (God).After the divorce, in 1993, the company claims bankruptcy. Dawson feels defeated; he can barely pay the bills and take care of his son that's living with him. In an episode of depression, Dawson contemplates taking his life, but something inside him tells him to keep his chin up for his children's sake.I don't want to give away the rest of the story but it's really good.

He needed to put some distance between himself and the memories of his disastrous and disappointing marriage and subsequent divorce.  As a Dom, he's aware his kink isn't for everyone, but surely out there somewhere is a woman who's fantasies involve being bare from head to toe.  Unfortunately his ex's betrayal is still fresh in his mind so finding the perfect submissive to compliment his tastes is going to be difficult - until he sees his fantasy woman in a magazine, then a billboard... and then shocker of all shockers, living right there in his condo building.Julie Silver discovered how much of an erogenous zone a shaved head can be when she agreed to go bald as a way of helping raise funds for cancer research.  She's a natural submissive but since her divorce hasn't ventured back into the BDSM scene; in fact, she hasn't even taken a lover simply because no one she's met has had the qualities she's looking for.  There's also the concern because of her newly discovered passion for going sans hair (and a few of her modeling jobs actually prefer her that way) but not many men would understand or share her intense satisfaction in keeping her head bald.Since the last assignment requiring Julie to shave off her locks, she's allowed it to grow back, but she has an upcoming modeling session and the client has requested she shave it off again.  Julie's fine with that, but she's become enamored of her neighbor Jimmy and fears he won't be interested in her once she's sporting a `chrome dome.'  She shouldn't have feared because Jimmy's already spotted the advertisement and the billboard featuring her and finds her look extremely desirable; however he hasn't put two and two together and realized that Julie is the girl in the ad yet.  Once he does, all bets are off!  Jimmy has no doubt that Julie is exactly what he needs in a submissive and he's more than determined to win in this game of love as he is in sacking quarterbacks on the football field.Ann Jacobs never fails to impress me with her writing - and the risks she takes with some of her characters.  For me it can go one way or the other - clean shaved head or long flowing locks on a man, but not once have I ever considered shaving off my own hair.  I certainly would have never considered it sexy, until I read SACKMASTER, now I'm thinking `why not?.'  It would certainly cut down on shampoo expenses!  SACKMASTER goes beyond this particular kink though and displays a genuine fondness for Dominance/submission that is appealing in its intensity while still being loving and fun.  Jimmy and Julie are high profile characters so it's interesting to see how their relationship plays out - especially since their career paths are so very different.  Ms. Jacobs' books have long been a staple in my reading library and this story is a prime example of why she is such a favored author.The NECESSARY ROUGHNESS series is a spinoff from Ms. Jacob's GRIDIRON LOVERS.

2677,2677,"Graham has a whole series of ""accidental..."" short books. It reminds of a Chaucer type format - each story is unique, with its own characters, and they are all morality tales of some sort. This one is particularly well written. It is a very old trope - money and success do not lead to happiness - but an interesting take. I think different stories in this series will appeal to different readers. This was my favorite to date (although Accidental Exorcist is a close second).",1,1,0.642857143,0.732142857,PA
2678,2678,"My typical taste runs to thrillers. Science fiction is often a nonstarter. Combining both, ""Tag"" could have easily gone either way. It has a few of the elements that will sometimes turn me off in sci-fi. These include  a lot of new technology, and new words and terms to learn.My objection to the technology isn't that it exists, but that it can sometimes become the story rather than assist it. This wasn't an issue for me in ""Tag."" The technology felt like a logical evolution from today to one hundred years into the future. It helped to define the story world, but didn't overpower the plot, with the characters, their personalities, and how that drove their actions taking center stage, as they should.My concern with language is that, if overdone, it can kill the flow of the story as the reader has to do an internal translation of the new words each time they see them. Royle uses many new terms. However, his word choices are easy to understand and quickly feel natural, as they often subtly reference other actual words in our vocabulary. Many are shortened words: kiloms as a measure of distance and mins for time. Dev is a generic electronic device, which combines what we would see as multiple functions in today's world, while a devstick is a portable device. Lev is a means of a person transporting from one place to another which references both an elevator and the word levitate, with both words helping cement its use in the reader's mind. His approach is a reminder that that the world is different, yet his choices  emphasize the differences while not getting in the way due to the ease of adding them to the reader's vocabulary.The story is the typical thriller, with a protagonist thrust into a race against time where the price for failure is high. The futuristic setting provides a backdrop for several themes. The 1984ish theme of Big Brother, and how technology, while positive, also has negatives, especially in the area of privacy. How human nature is unchanging. That there will always be those who feel they are above everyone else and have no qualms in acting on those feelings. But I didn't realize much of this until I had time to reflect, after the fast-paced ride to the end.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

2679,2679,"TAG is a great story and details a very immersive world. The plot went from thin to thick and deep really quickly and kept getting deeper as the story went one. So much is happening at a lot of points in the book that you don't know who is on what side and who you are rooting for as the hero. There was even a love story mixed in that helped push the plot along instead of boring someone like me who is not into reading romance. The way the characters are interact and relate made this a page turner.The only real negative that I had with the book was the way that everything was over described. The short forms that the author believes we will be talking in were severely overused for my taste and kept drawing me out of the story. I didn't count, but listing heights in 'cents' (of course short for centimetres) was the worst of the offenders of this and I almost put the book down a couple times because of it. Other descriptive terms were used so much that they made me shake my head in distaste. If it wasn't for the great story and plot I would have been slowed to halt by those speed bumps.Cover to cover, TAG is a good read for those that like a little science fiction mixed with conspiracy stories. If something like the Illuminati interests you, this is a must read.

2680,2680,"I was a little hesitant when I first received this book. The blurb sounded quite science-fictioney (yeah, that's a word!) and I thought I may have been a little out of my comfort zone. However, I was about to have a very pleasant surprise.Tag is more futuristic than science-fiction, and the technological advances of 2110 are not far-fetched, they are easily imaginable. International travel has become a breeze, cash is a thing of the past and convenience is exactly what the word suggests. But although the world has a pretty surface, underneath planet Earth and its surroundings are quickly descending into 1984-esque habits, without even realizing what is happening.The characters in Tag are complex, well-drawn and likeable, despicable or sitting on the fence. Allegiances are formed and withdrawn as the story progresses, and the twists are surprising and sometimes heart-wrenching. The story is told either in first person POV through Jonah, or third person POV through other key characters.There are a few small niggles for me in this book - the physical descriptions of the characters are a little repetitive, there are a couple of small errors and there are a few places in the book where the action takes a dip - but these could be easily rectified by a good editor, and make Tag a truly fantastic book.Apart from these small issues, I was very impressed and enthralled by Tag. Don't be put off thinking this book is science-fiction - it is in a way, but it's a book that would appeal to anyone that enjoys a good thriller, a good story or an excellent futuristic book!",1,1,0.581939799,0.73396169,PA

It grabbed my interest right at the onset by starting off with a mysterious murder.James Blake is the number one suspect in what is believed to be, the murder of his wife, Julia. He is driven to solve this crime out of love for his deceased wife. He defies the legal system in London and makes his way to Florence, Italy to retrace her last steps in order to make some sense of her untimely death. The more information he gleans from her encrypted work on her computer, the more clues he finds to help solve her murder. His own life is at risk as well as the lives of his brother Miles and friend Sergio when they try to help him.There are many unexpected twists and turns in this well-written novel.

I was interested to learn that many of these `lost' paintings, such as the one featured in the story `Leda and the Swan' were very often painted over to save them from being destroyed. Julia is using a newly developed scanning technique, desperate for a breakthrough in her career.When James Blake finds his wife murdered, there begins a complicated unravelling of her work and James becomes caught up with the powerful, dangerous Italian family Julia was working for.The locations are wonderful.

A nice art industry mystery without focusing much on actual industry. Set between London and Italy, this is about a man who finds his wife murdered and goes on the quest to find out why and by whom. The first obstacle is the fact that the police inspector seems to think he is the most likely culprit. Enlisting the help of his brother, he leaves for Florence to find anything that can lead him to find the reason someone would have wanted to kill his wife. He gets wrapped up with a very large ""crime"" family and the world of art restoration (his wife's occupation).The book has great suspense and mystery along with gritty action.

Several twists had me thinking, ""I wish I'd thought of that!,"" and the complicated attempt to bring down a Mafia type clan, no sure thing at the outset, is skillfully and believably set forth. I would only suggest an occasional change of the emotional pace - the more to entrap the reader, if you will - and a few more details about the settings, to distinguish the Italian locations more clearly from each other.

I love that her bois are always (to some extent) willing subjects, aroused by the idea of expressing their hidden femininity, and curious about how far they can push it. Here, everything starts with a simple request for hubby to take part in a boudoir photo shoot, providing his wife with a compliment for her own shoot. As nervous about how she'll react as about how he'll look, he reluctantly agrees.Things start out slow, with a fairly routine photo shoot that proceeds from casual to softcore sexy. The wife is a bit of an enigma here, pushing things forward, but also appearing reluctant or uncertain herself. This leaves poor hubby to take responsibility for his own participation, and to acknowledge the fact that he not only wants to keep going, but is enjoying it. By the time the hunky lighting assistant steps into the scene, and the photographer asks if he'd stand next to hubby to demonstrate the contrast between them, you kind of know where the story is going. Despite that, it's still a surprise when everybody agrees it would make for a hot photo to see his naked manhood pressed against hubby's naked butt cheeks . . . and you know it can't stop there.Hot, sexy, and incredibly detailed, this is a fantasy cum true.",1,1,0.6045627379999999,0.901140685,PA

I highly recommend this Western, especially for people who love a good old fashioned western style cowboy book.Boomer was a well written story of a sheriff who befriended an orphaned Native American boy. It covered all the aspects of a western story, including: Outlaws, shootouts, saloon brawls & fun, quick justice at the end of a rope, and several swooning western romances.The characters are bold, whether nice or ornery, the plot flows easily, and the last half kept me up late just to finish it.

2701,2701,"Contains some spoilers...This story rates between a 1 and a 1.5. It was very unique...but in an peculiar way. It was kind of like Twilight meets I Am Legend.If you do not like the YA genre, then this is not the book for you. With that said, I am not a fan of the YA so I struggled reading this book. The premise of the story seems a bit too immature for an adult audience. Starla and her friend Jordan become vampires so that they can be wealthy and glamorous but the story opens with the two friends standing outside of Jordan former childhood home; now kicked out and homeless because of her new vampiric state. The two Blood Sisters resign themselves to their new status and go looking for their first ""meal"" as vampires. They stumble upon a house with a former classmate who was reviled by Jordan because he used her sexually and then threw her away. A midnight snack and revenge at the same time...two birds, one stone. Perfect, right? Wrong, the girls' effort is thwarted by a usurper. He stole their meal and drained their first meal dry...taking away the opportunity for a meal and revenge. Darn!Poor girls...now, what are they gonna do, it's not like they can pick up blood in aisle thirteen at their local grocer. Nope, they have to figure out another food source. They continue their hunting and wind up at a local nightclub. They target a young girl, a doppelg&auml;nger for Starla according to Jordan, as their victim. The girls have their first food fight, literally, as the battle over who will win the quarry. Their first attempt of food acquiry ends in an epic failure. Their young victim escapes them while they are fighting each other over who gets to draw first blood. Starla's ""twin"" runs back into the club shrieking and the girls end up hungry...still.Pitiful humans turned into pathetic vampires...not a pretty picture at all. After their failed attempt to secure food, the girls find themselves at the playground where they were turned into vampires. Their arrival at the playground commences a sequence of events that change their vampiric lives forever.I say that this book reminds me of I am Legend because the vampires were described as completely hairless (even the females) with a gray skintone.The story struck me as disjointed. I could see where the pieces were supposed to connect but they were done so haphazardly. It was as if puzzle pieces of the story were dumped on the floor and the reader had to put the picture together. Mystery or suspense novel provide the reader with pieces or clues so that they can put together the final picture to figure outwho done it, why'd they do it, or what happened. However, since this book fit into neither genre it was not a particularly enjoyable experience piecing together the why's and what's of the story.The characters were just too juvenille to have broader appeal to an adult audience. The primary character ages were about sixteen or seventeen. Starla and Jordan were very scatterbrained (per impulsive descision to become a vampire without thinking through the ramifications); shallow (Starla vandalized and robbed a store to get a leather coat, boots, and sunglasses); and whiny (Starla didn't want to drink blood which made her weak...human...but raged and moaned when someone refered to her as such). Such a spastic trichotomy.Then there was the whole storyline of Mercer's grandfather being able to purify Starla's blood since she hadn't drank human blood. They were going to perform a dialysis of sorts and remove her blood, purify it, and put it back into her body and voila the vampire demon would be excised from her body turning her into a half-human, like Mercer. Dialysis...hmmm...really?!?! The description of the entire process was just too pedestrian. The story definately could have been made more if that storyline and process had been fleshed out a bit more.My feelings on the book are neutral; I did not totally hate it but, most likely, will not read it again. The book began with automatic strike for me because it was a YA which I do not typically read. However, in spite of my non-YA book policy, I have read one or two others and actually enjoyed them because they appealed to me on an intellectual level. The stories were mature in a way that elminiated the teen fiction novel feel. Unfortunately, this book was just too teenyboppery for me to really enjoy.",1,0,0.597254005,0.134248665,PA

Their crazy schemes to correct the situation involve an elopement and wild chase through a thunderstorm.  It's funny and sad.

One character's dialogue follows another without the proper breaks. It becomes confusing when you're wondering why a character is speaking for another.Believe me when I say it's an enjoyable read. I only hope if there's a sequel, it's edited better.",1,1,0.669811321,0.779874214,PA

2711,2711,"This novelette is a beautiful and touching little story that hits the spot during this festive season. It may change your attitude to panhandlers.The main character is a single, unemployed father who can't find work and is trying his best to take care of his daughter Angie while avoiding charity or welfare. So he begs on the streets. His wife abandoned them and took off to Vegas to pursue a career as a showgirl and provides no support. It's usually deadbeat Dads we read about and here it is a deadbeat Mom.The author is from Vancouver, B.C. and says the story is based on a real experience from an interview he did with a street panhandler in downtown Vancouver after he took him out for a meal and took notes.Greg, the main character, meets an old girlfriend who lends a helping hand to him and his daughter. When his daughter suffers a fall and goes into a coma in hospital, Greg finds himself at his lowest point. But he soon learns that there is sometimes a reason why things happen.I enjoyed this short read, only 95 pages, and found it generally an uplifting, moving story. My only problem is with the ending which I found abrupt.Spoiler Alert:It left the reader hanging about whether his daughter Angie wakes up. It simply said: ""If you're an optimist, she wakes up"", ""if you're a pessimist, she doesn't."" The story really doesn't have closure and I'm a firm believer that a story should have a beginning, a middle and an end. I think it's a bit of a cop-out for an author to leave it up to the reader to decide the ending. Other people may differ with my opinion, but that's why I give it 4 stars instead of five. But still a worthwhile read and it's properly edited too.",1,1,0.592592593,0.592592593,PA

2713,2713,"Ok, let me start with the statement that I love ghost stories, LOVE 'em.  I am also not someone who throws a book down in disgust and doesn't finish it. I finished this book...read every stinkin' word, first with interest, then in puzzlement, progressing to disbelief.  My thoughts are as follows:1.  Not one, not two, but EVERY character in this story behaves in a completely unbelievable fashion (oh the little kid almost gets hit by a car then disappears into the cemetery, gosh, maybe we ought to look then call the police tomorrow if we don't see her, but ...gosh.. totally forgot about that.2.  There is no consistency between characters and scenes. None...at...all3.  Story lines are started, then completely dropped, with an entirely different plotline popping up.  Kind of like flipping channels on a tv, but with the same actors on screen...mostly.4.  If you are going to write about cemeteries, go to one.  Coffins do not litter the ground; those are called headstones or monuments.  Coffins are buried fairly deep, like 6 feet or so, not just under the topsoil.  The newly dead are embalmed and jaw shut before the burial, which usually takes more than..oh say 12 hours after she died on a plane...in another jurisdiction.  Oh,  and the puritans of the Salem witch trial era did not use mausoleums, particularly not for a victim of the witch trials, nor would you be able to just pop that coffin open and take a look.5.  If you are going to write about victims of the Salem witch trials, do some research beyond grabbing their names. i.e. their remains were not chained together and ""lost,"" they didn't all die the same way or in the same week. These were real people and an historical tragic event.  Either treat it with a little respect and research or make up an entirely different event.6.  Don't have the court say one thing, then act like the witch trials themselves, but have no development of that before sending minors to jail with no charges, but, hey, cell bars can't hold these girls anyway, huh?7.  Don't rip off Norman Bates and put him in a witch hat. Just don't.8.  Ok, minor point.  The plane ride from Vermont to Boston is not a long trip to the point of exhaustion for a teenager unless they got routed through dfw, but in your story it is one flight, you know, where the old woman with the portent of doom died.9.  Use a thesaurus.  Look up ""bragged,"" pick a synonym.  Repeat process for other words.10.  Oh, cell phones do work across state lines, and when the kid is trapped with a psycho killer, roaming charge be d***d. The state line thing was a recurring factor, thus a recurring irritant.  The phone would work, as would 911.When I started this story, it was with the attitude that this will be a fun YA ghost story; then I decided that it must have been written BY a kid, so don't be cruel or snarky.  After reading the blurb after the ending that the author is a columnist who has been published in several outlets, I decided to write this, my first negative review.  I usually just forget about it if I hate a book, never understanding people giving bitterly negative reviews to a free book; but this story is just badly written and badly researched (yes, you should do some research, even for YA fiction, maybe even, ESPECIALLY for YA fiction.)  Some of the free-form ""plotting"" could have been developed into a decent story - there were glimpses of what could be - but it just didn't happen. If your kids (or you) enjoyed this story, just understand that there are infinitely better ones out there, some that even have some accuracy about Salem and the witch trial, and, frankly, some that even make some sort of sense. Loosely tying together some creepy imagery does not make a story.",1,0,0.6238881829999999,-0.376111817,PA

Yes we've all got dreams of finding true love but here's was almost an obsession. (Remember that would for later). Gabriel was just as bad when his character came off as heartless, rude, and condescending. Then again I guess that was the only way to tolerate Alice.The story itself was all over the place but the one detail that stood out was Alice was practically stalking Gabriel. The girl just couldn't take a hint. Over and over and over and over he tried pushing her away. Even if he didn't want to, he still did it. But she refused to budge. Yes, persistence can be beneficial if it's done correctly but Alice was almost in need of psychiatric help. Then after, basically, forcing him to have sex with her (which was obsolete in the book) she would settle for friends with benefits even though she's in love with him?

The author thereby made the character, with his handicap, more believeable. The story holds your attention from start to finish. The only thing wrong with it is...IT IS TOO SHORT!

2720,2720,"""The Grimm Curse"" was a very well-written novella by Stephen Carpenter. Although it was written for a young teen audience, I still found it to be an entertaining story. The characterization was good and the plot was definitely interesting and unique. The chills were mild for an adult but would certainly thrill a younger audience. I don't understand the negative reviews that criticize the writing quality, because this was an excellent, well-written story in every way.As other reviewers have said, this book seems to be a prologue for a series. I received it for free, but I would have been unhappy with the length if I had paid $2.99 for it. ""The Grimm Curse"" is certainly worth full price in terms of quality,  but I have a personal price limit on what I pay for shorter works and full-length books. For example, I paid $2.99 for Mr. Carpenter's full-length book ""Killer"" and and consider it to be a bargain.I hadn't realized that this book was the basis for the television series ""Grimm"". As an adult, I relate better to the characters as adults, but ""The Grimm Curse"" would be a wonderful YA book series that would still appeal to adults. In a perfect world, Mr. Carpenter would write two series, one with a teenaged Jacob, and a parallel one with Jacob as an adult. I would be happy to read both.",1,1,0.650557621,0.755390335,PA

The truth.Molly Grace Belden Copeland is the 24/7 slave (and wife) to Clayton Copeland. She exists only to please him in a total sublimation of self. If that means accepting his beatings, then she's happy to suffer. If she's to crawl about naked on all fours on a leash, she's as eager to please as a caged dog fed table scraps.""She had long ago learned to hold her desires and wants silent like a secret in her heart, and wait to hear what he wanted. She lived to fulfill his needs.""When her Master is called away on mysterious business, he loans her out to Mephisto, a bdsm club owner, for safe keeping and (let's call it) inservice training.""I've arranged for someone else, another Master I trust, to watch over you and put you through your paces while I'm gone. That way I know you're occupied and behaving yourself,"" he tell her, but after she expresses gratitude at his foresight and cleverness, he warns, ""Mephisto is an exacting Master. Much more so than I.  I coddle you shamelessly.""Under Mephisto exacting, brutal care, Molly is put through the paces of being beaten & whipped and used as a sex toy for Mephisto's pleasure and that of his club patrons. Yet there is chemistry between them and a concern that Mephisto has for her that is evident throughout the book. Although he is much more brutal than Clayton ever thought of being, Mephisto expresses concern for Molly's happiness and sees a person under the submissive. It is through him that the reader learns Molly's full name and that she is quite educated, with a degree in environmental studies.With face-slapping honesty, Annabel Joseph dissects a sadomasochistic total power exchange relationship. It's not a comfortable read, but a compelling one that keeps you turning pages despite dismay (horror) at the brutality of the scenes. Her writing is superb and the story unfolds with well-paced precision. Club Mephisto is told entirely from Molly's point of view. The next book, Molly's Lips: Club Mephisto Retold, revisits what occurs during Molly's week at the club from Mephisto's point of view.Club Mephisto is a 5 star read, but not for everyone.",1,1,0.641025641,0.8205128209999999,PA

The story is about two families who man a lighthouse on Isle Royale in Lake Superior.  They live a quiet, some may say boring, life in this desolate area.

I was impressed, understanding that both so emotional genres can be joined in one book and this gives an exiting reading, as a result. Now I've received one more confirmation of significant impression - ""Edge Play X"" is a great example of almost-obsessing reading.The story is deeper, than I expected. It can't be named as ""light"" or ""easy"" reading. M. Jarrett Wilson describes strong and complicated characters. A dominatrix named X had quite an easy target, which turned out in a hard choice. Dominating Terry Compton is scary, even extremely dangerous. Especially, concerning the fact, that CIA believes he murdered a previous woman. The problem will grow up quickly after X's significant travel to Paris and what's happened there. Now she doesn't know what she believes in and whom she can trust.We have a chance to take a look at X's thoughts. She feels lost and confused between three men -- Compton, Simeon, and Michael. When you begin to understand her actions and her concerns, you'll see that this book is not simply enjoyable reading, it combines intellectual, erotic and thriller parts.

This is why it got 5 stars...Sweet as Sin is a deep, raw and intense read.John Murphy stole my heart, from the minute his cheekiness brought him to Livvi's door. John is a tortured soul, emotionally scarred so deeply, by an extremely abusive stepfather. Those scars rule every aspect of his life. So much so that he is unable to have any form of long-standing relationship except with the sister he has always protected.John is an author who writes a series about two monsters, Jondi and Thorn. These monsters came to life when he was a child trying to safe-guard his sister, telling her the stories late at night to help her (and himself) escape the fears and hurt from the mental and physical abuse they both suffered. Those monsters have protected him and given him a safe place to escape to his entire life. Until he moves next door to Livvi and everything changes....Livvi is an extremely talented pastry chef and owner of the specialty bakery; the Sugar Shack. She is a very strong and independent woman, she knows what she wants. She too has had a tough childhood with a cheating father.The chemistry between John and Livvy is yummy HOT! However, what starts off as a bit of a fling soon turns out to be much more, as both being damaged by their respective childhood, makes their connection that much more emotional and intense.John and Livvi's journey is a beautiful story, it is passionate, emotional and very well written!(When I started this book my amazing friend Jenny mentioned to me that once I'd finished reading this story, I should go read an update with John and Livvy a few years later on Inez Kelley's website. I asked Jenny to remind me of this cause I might forget. I DID NOT forget. It was the first place I went as soon as I'd finished..because I NEEDED to know. I needed that final confirmation that John and Livvy were OK...that they were happy...!!!

2749,2749,"Sweet as SinReviewed by Ann & posted at Under The Covers Book BlogSWEET AS SIN starts off with John Murphy, a successful YA writer walking over to his neighbour's home to return a scarlet demi bra that flew into his yard on a gust of wind. Naturally, the lingerie catches his attention and causes erotic fantasies to fly and rumble around in his head.I had a similar experience as this, though mind you, mine involved hot pink panties instead of the scarlet demi bra but I can tell you my story didn't end up as fabulous or as delicious as John's trip to his neighbour's.Why, I must ask. Why does this only happen in books? Inez Kelley, please rewrite the pages of my life so that THIS happens in it.""Yeah, it's a neighborhood tradition. Come over. Bring your wife and kids.""A twitch danced along his upper lip before he grinned. ""Can't. Don't have either.""Livvy lowered her brows. A shiver slid along her skin and she fought the shake. He was far too cocky to encourage. ""Then bring your girlfriend.""""No girlfriend to bring.""""Bring your boyfriend then.""A bark of a laugh rumbled out. ""Sorry, honey, you're just stuck with me.""""I don't want you,"" she snapped.John leaned close. The scent of sunshine, man and power wrapped around her. ""Maybe I want you.""*shivers*But I digress.In all seriousness, this book was a fantastic read that captured my heart from the beginning and never let go until the very end. I read this book in one night with tears running down my cheeks. This from an author I have never read before and had no expectations of. Inez caught me by surprise and I can tell you that she has gained a new fan out of me.SWEET AS SIN follows Livvy, a pastry chef and the dark and tortured writer, whose past still haunts him daily. I didn't expect the emotion that Kelley evoked from me. Touched by the love that developed between Livvy and John and heart-broken when things began to shatter for them, this book took me on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I didn't think I could come to love and hate a character in equal measures. John Murphy is an extraordinary character that really came to life. Even as his outbursts caused me to step back a little, I still loved him. I can't remember the last time a character felt so alive for me.And then there is Livvy who has a heart made of gold and a spine made of steel. What she endures in this book to be with John is hard but magical. In those steps, she is able to go from a reluctant lover who needed some urgings from her sexy neighbour to a woman in love, someone willing to fight for it all.This isn't an easy read, there are some really dark places that this book delves into, but if you are looking for a tortured hero, then look no further, no one is as tortured as John Murphy. Similarly, John isn't always the wickedly charming man as I've exampled above. As layers to his character are revealed, other darker sides of him are exposed as well. He says and does some really mean things that I don't think Livvy deserved but he did what was necessary to push her away. For John, only his monsters are his companions.Speaking of his monsters, I really enjoyed the glimpses into John's characters in his writing. Jondi, Thorn and Vory gave the book additional life and served as a great way to get into John's mind and see how it works.In the end, SWEET AS SIN has become my new favorite book. It is sweet and sinful, decadent and entirely satisfying. Definitely a treat to be shared and devoured by all. I loved it!Favorite Quote: ""Love him hard. And when he pushes you away - and he will - love him harder.""",1,1,0.6256476679999999,0.75777202,NC
2750,2750,"This was a wonderful book. I loved the fact that the authors took the time to write a back story so that the eventual relationship made perfect sense.This book is co-dependency at its best. Holly is adrift in the world & needs boundaries to feel safe. Nick finds peace in creating these boundaries. Unlike other BDSM books where the TPE seems contrived & based on a sexual foundation, Nick & Holly's relationship was about serving each other's needs. Holly is a 'natural' submissive. Not because he is a weak person but because he delights in showing his love via his 'service' to Nick. Nick isn't all that Alpha but he delights in accepting what Holly is willing to give.Other reviewers (on Amazon) have said that they found Nick's ignorance about his bi-sexuality unbelievable. I think this was nicely explained by his need to conform to the ideals of 'best practice' in life. He made CHOICES based on expectations from society & family; then suppressed his true needs & desires to live up to the choices he made. I don't think this is abnormal given the pressures people are under from society to conform.I also didn't find Holly's subservience incongruous. He was described early in the book as affectionate & tactile. Given his barren childhood (aloof father, sick mother & resentful siblings) & his need for reassurance, his desire for 'petting' & affection is perfectly understandable.Most books of the genre expect me to suspend belief & forgive major plot holes.

The characters draw me to them and their story, engrossing me in their world - in a time and space I could never go without them.The story takes me into the legends of Nimrod, the tower of Babel, and deeper than the legends, into the presence of angels and the power of God. Now I am about to go with two young people on a quest as exciting as the quest for the holy grail. All the time I keep the company of unforgettable/likable characters. What more could I ask for in a pleasurable and exciting read?The tension keeps building as the young people travel toward their destination. Evil is always one step behind them and danger continually trips them, but they fight off the foe as they are confronted; and always near by, the messengers of God watch.There are even some pre-historic animals for added tension. The issues of trust and the fear of others misunderstanding one are thought provoking. I wonder how my trust in God will effect my ability to trust others and let God handle the results when I am willing to give up the desire to always be in control.And how does our faith effect others? Are we better witnesses of the power and glory of God by our words, or by our faith in our actions?This is a good story.

2758,2758,"I'm a fan of the J.R. Rain Samantha Moon series.  There are a few Samantha Moon short stories to date, and one of them is in this collection along with two other shorts by Rain.J.R. Rain is a prolific writer who has written a lot of books, and the writing gene is abundant in his family... several of his family members are also writers.  I'm not sure where exactly in chronological order the Moon short stories fit into the novels/novellas of the series.  I really do wish I knew.  I read this one after finishing books 1-4.  Personally, I think it best to get introduced to Samantha in Moon Dance (Vampire for Hire #1) before reading any of the shorts.I've read a few of his other non-Moon works that he's collaborated on with other writers, both shorts and novels, and enjoyed it all so far, but the Samantha Moon material is by far my favorite.I won't go into detail about the plot lines because other reviewers have done so already, and done so pretty well.  Basically, if you're looking to collect the Samantha Moon shorts and want to try some of his other stuff, this collection is a way to do it.

2771,2771,"San Francisco, 1857. Della Gilliland has been making her way in the world by selling harmless medicines, but one of her *patients* has just died and she's being wrongfully blamed for it. With the law hot on her heels and justice in San Francisco somewhere questionable, Della figures her safest bet is to get on the first ship heading out-of-town. But how to get on board when there's not enough money for it? Why, she marches up to ever-so-handsome Kenton Bradford (of the New York Bradfords!) and introduces herself to his business associate as his wife. Bemused, Kenton plays along at first, but confessing the truth could squash his hopes of a business deal, so he finds himself stuck in the role for the entire trip back East.This being a romance novel and all I think you'll guess where the rest of the story is headed, although Hiatt lets that part of the story build slowly. Della and Kent start off talking about their lives and getting to know one another as friends - you aren't going to get insta love and steamy kisses on every page. Once that spark ignites, the path to true love gets a bit rocky when they face a wee bit of a storm at sea...Here's the deal. Despite that seriously cheesy cover on the older edition, this is not a sexed up romance, so if that's what you're looking for I'd suggest you pass and keep on looking. As I mentioned, Della and Kent spend a great deal of the first part of the book talking and getting to know each other. The latter part of the book is based on a real historical event, the final voyage of the SS Central America, so they're a bit too busy with other priorities to be bed-hopping.My thoughts? While not the greatest book evar, this was a good solid read for me and really couldn't put it down, and one of the better Kindle freebies I've picked up. Adding a lesser known bit of history, and keeping events as close to what happened as possible is a huge plus for a history geek like me, and I thought the author did a nice job with it. According to the author's notes at the end (always appreciated!), several of the characters she wrote into Della and Kent's story were passengers on the SS Central America. 3.5/5 stars.",1,1,0.6039387310000001,0.504923414,NC
2772,2772,"This was my first book by Hiatt and I was impressed with how well she portrayed an historic event through the eyes of a man and woman falling in love. I love historical romances that integrate real history and real historical figures (and do not just use historical settings as background ""wallpaper""). This one does it very well.SHIP of DREAMS is a romance, yes, but a romance wrapped around the true story of the sinking of the luxury sidewheel steamer SS Central America (aka the Ship of Gold for all the gold it carried) that went down in a hurricane off the Carolina coast in 1857.Della Gilliland, seller of herbal tonics and the daughter of a gold miner, and Kenton Bradford of the wealthy ""New York Bradfords"" meet in San Francisco onboard a steamship as Della is fleeing a false accusation of murder (for one of her tonics). Seeking to hide among the first class passengers, Della introduces herself as Kent's wife. Startled, he plays along with the ruse and finds himself falling in love with the beautiful Irish girl, no matter he is engaged to another woman, a woman he does not love.Hiatt is a superb storyteller and I soon found myself absorbed--both in the romance and life aboard the steamship. Della is a strong, unpretentious, unselfish heroine and Kent is a noble man whose love for the adventurous Della changes him into a better man. The emotion between Della and Kent is believable, the chemistry real and the love scenes appropriate. The steamship travel from San Francisco to the East Coast via Panama and the hurricane that hit the ship are an integral part of the story and obviously reflect considerable research. All in all, I think Hiatt did an incredible job of bringing both the Victorian period in America and this incident in history to life. I highly recommend it.",1,1,0.612068966,0.589249493,NC

And, I can't remember the last time I had to go into my computer's command line to run programs, as the author recommends here.  All I can say is that this seems like an extremely daunting approach to formatting ebooks.  Of course, I really won't know until I try it.  It may very well be that I will come back to this book to solve a prickly formatting problem, so I will reserve judgment on that - IF I can figure out what the author is saying.There is also a section at the end on how to format for the Nook readers.  This also comes after another negative introduction about why one should NOT publish for ANY other format other than Kindle.  The author may be right, but many successful authors would also disagree.  At least the information is there.  So, this goes on the virtual shelf to gather virtual dust which I may have to blow off someday.",1,0,0.637096774,-0.045362902999999996,NC

Reminds me of the old Saturday afternoon serial matinee where ""our hero"" was about to be pushed off the cliff.

Next Saturday...That's all this book is:  leaves the reader ""dangling"" with this paranormal murder series.

2785,2785,"This is the first book in the ""Twilight of the Empire"" series, the trilogy prequel to Green's eight volume ""Deathstalker"" series. If you've read and enjoyed the Deathstalker books I expect you would enjoy this trilogy. If you are new to Green's work, this would be a fine place to begin.""Mistworld"" displays Green's finely balanced ability to tell a stirring space opera style tale while still injecting bits of humor and other business that lighten the mood at appropriate times. Some of Green's other series are played more for humor and snappy patter, (the supernatural Nightside books, especially, and the pun filled James Bond homage ""Secret History"" series to a lesser extent), and I'm a big fan of both. ""Mistworld"", though, follows a more serious and traditional line.Green does great villains. His bad guys are remorselss and creepy. Maybe it is the underlying air of arch and bemused detachment he brings to the affair, but in any event they just jump off the page in waves of malice. As a complement, he does menace with real aplomb. Not scary, but malevolent. In Nightside this is played a bit for laughs; they are just so over the top. Here, he tones it down a bit, and that just makes the villains even creepier. In opposition to this his heroes, (or anti-heroes or reluctant heroes), are conflicted, and never fully confident in their odds of prevailing, despite their outward appearance of confidence and capability. This makes his heroes particularly appealing and engaging.Once you have that going for you, pretty much any space opera plot will work. But even here, Green supplies twists and turns and layers that keep the reader interested and invested. This book is interesting because everything happens on Mistworld, and Mistworld is a pretty claustrophobic place. Hemmed in and blockaded Mistworld is hanging on by a thread. All the characters have histories with each other, but there are still plenty of surprises as the plot and its various subplots unfold.So, this isn't sword and sorcery, or light sabre and sorcery, or supernatural, although there are hints of that style. This is gritty and dark and sometimes reads more like futuristic noir than anything else. All of these are good things, and if any of this sounds interesting, well Green is a good author to know.Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book in exchange for a candid review.

2786,2786,"I really wanted to like this book.  However the way the events unfolded was just too unrealistic. Now I LOVE paranormal books, so reading about instant attraction or even sex with a stranger is not new.  But the heroine in this book goes from being kidnapped by some random stranger to being in love with said random stranger in all of 20 seconds (OK it was more like a few hours...but still).  Then, even if by chance the main characters developed some deep bond over shared experiences or common interests, again, I can swallow that.  But that never happened. They went from exchanging names to a public make-out session which went beyond just  fondling, straight into anal sex then into 'I love you's'.  Umm, WAIT.  WHAT??!!  Too much, too soon, with no discussion of developing feelings. About the storyline. The IDEA was GREAT. Putting it all together? Not so much.  I skipped over a lot of the dialogue.

If you want and enjoyable quick read then you shouldn't be disappointed.I took a star away from my rating because the male characters were ok. They seemed hot enough but for me they didn't sizzle and I like that in the males - dominant alphas all the way! The sex scenes were the same - hot but little sizzle!

Once a month, she steps into her fantasy of being dominated with her neighbor's rough commands and the cries of pleasure as the soundtrack filtering through her wall. What she didn't realize - if she can hear him, then he can hear her. She's about to have the experience of her life at the hands of Kade Berges and The Pleasure Brigade.My first Cara Carnes experience and I loved it! The plot is both sexy and funny. Autumn is so in tune with the goings on next door that she knows most of her neighbor's habits - what type of female her prefers, how long the sexcapades usually last, and what laughter at the door means. Then Kade knocks on her door.Autumn has yearned to explore more of her sexuality, but her ex boyfriend was as vanilla as they got. Kade gives her a little taste of what she can expect if she accepts his offer to play with him and his closest friends and gives her an entire month to think about submitting to The Pleasure Brigade.I loved Autumn's openness to exploration and experimentation. She's obviously a more than willing participant, and the men treat her with a bit of reverence and respect while still maintaining their Dom personas. Even though she is shared among the four men, she wasn't merely a tool for their pleasure. The scenes in this short story were incendiary! I thought she had chemistry with all of them, but perhaps moreso with Kade since he laid claim to her first. This is obviously just the beginning, and it looks like there will be a series of adventures waiting for Autumn and Kade.Fans of menage or more will definitely enjoy this story!

2791,2791,"Another wonderfully spicy historical western romance from a very talented author. Eden Pace is a gambler and is on the trail of the notorious outlaw Ansell Black who was behind the death of her husband. Eden uses her skill as a high stakes poker player to draw Black out of hiding. To her dismay she instead draws the possessive attention of Sam ""Snake"" MacAllister, a rough and ready bounty hunter.Sam rides with his bounty hunter cousins, Deacon and Charlie ""Wolf"" MacAllister who were featured in Wolf's Tender. Eden has a bounty on her head and falls into Sam's ready hands.Eden was a single minded, fiesty, determined, independent heroine and she certainly led the very possessive Sam a merry chase.Sam is a rough man who has his limitations and is aware of them, but he is certainly up to the task of protecting Eden and keeping her safe from her own folly. I liked the gentle humour of Sam as he carefully thought out how best to deal with Eden and her quest for vengeance.This book is no different to any other historical western written by this author. Excellent characters, a wonderful heroine and a strong hero. Enough ""heat"" between the major characters to keep it interesting.

After investing my time to read this book I wish I had.  I liked Ted and all the guys at the beginning.  They seemed to have a special friendship.  Everything was going well until Ted looses his grandmother.  His whole attitude towards Caroline was disgusting. After profesing his undying love, making her his wife and promising to be with her no matter what.  What does he do? .... Closes her out and then outright leaves her????  After she gave everything up for him?? After the second wedding when she gave him an OUT! She moved for him and was willing to follow him where ever he chose to go.  He uproots himself and changes his whole life and when she asks him what she's supposed to do he pretty much tells her he doesn't care.  He gets himself a new life.  But what totally disgusted me was that he took off his ring..for him the marriage was over.  When Smitty sends him the invitation he goes running to see him!?!? Really?!?!  After not even wanting his wife's own name mentioned????  At Smity's party he's fine sitting next to Caroline (who he hasn't seen in two months). After he is forgiven by his friends he even toasts him but does not mention his wife.  Only after she leaves does he even think of apologising to her (after he has the approval from everyone-he couldn't handle going against the world for her--- His grandmother would've been so disappointed in him)..  I liked Caroline throughout the story.  However, when he left she did not get control of her life and did something she said she wouldn't do again---loose herself to a man.  ----She was going to wait for him to come back to her?!?!? Really?!?? After the way he left her?!?!  And all the things he said to her?!?!  But what frustrated me the most was that she let him come back without any consequence to his actions.Really?!?!

2796,2796,"NOTE:  THIS REVIEW IS FILLED WITH SPOILERS ****************There are many things that are objectionable in this story so let me start with the positive side:  I didn't throw it across the room AND I did think a lot about the plot and how characters might react to this type of situation.  It takes a certain level of writing to create a story that stays with you; unlike so many other romances, I will remember this one.  Hence two stars instead of one.Unfortunately, this doesn't begin to outweigh the minuses of this book.  I'll only mention the most egregious.First I wasn't even vaguely convinced of  Ted and Caroline's overwhelming love for each other.  It was definitely tell don't show.  But let's say we accept the overwhelming strength of this love, it made it was still unbelievable that he  knowingly threw away his closest friendships after only knowing her a week and knowing NOTHING about her.  This in turn led to one of the biggest inconsistencies of the book:  if Ted's love was so great, why on earth did he leave his beloved new wife when he realized the consequences of his actions? After all, she was all he had left.  None of that made sense and just made you dislike Ted -- he is a self-indulgent jerk.Also, I usually greatly enjoy books that also include the other friendships of hero and heroine, but in this book the men all behaved like teenage girls  (and I don't only mean that they cried a lot).  Also, the light look into the romances of Ted's friends was all a bit strange:  you get part of their stories but not enough to make you care.As for Caroline:  after reading the entire book, I still know nothing of HER backstory (I knew more about Ted's friend Smitty who is a secondary character!) I didn't know what made her tick at all and felt that she was just a cardboard figure moving through the book.  It would have helped to know a bit more about her to help explain her willingness to take Ted back!There were lots of other questions that arose:  like how could Ted's mother have sided with his friend over her son???  Or how is it conceivable that Smitty, who had been Ted's closest friend for over 20 years, never once confronted Ted about his taking Caroline?  Instead he goes off to live in Australia?? When he didn't even live in the same town as Ted to start with?Finally, the denouement:  the reception where Smitty forgives Ted and tells everyone present about his background (oh, and he hadn't told his best friend in the world this background in over 20 years??)  and suddenly all problems are solved.  This was too neat a way to wrap things up in a hurry.  I didn't believe this scene for one minute.These are just a few of the many inexplicable things that occur in this story.  It had an interesting premise but that is about the only good thing to say about this book.",1,0,0.5902192239999999,-0.035124067,NC
2797,2797,"This is the story of a detective and his new partner encountering a murder case.  The case becomes something much more than solving a basic murder when details come to light regarding people related to murder victim.  And it becomes an issue of solving more than one case and adding assistance from FBI and Navy.  The premise, while not a new one, has merit.  The specifics are predictible in some parts and there are no real twists to getting to the ""who done it"" and why.  However, that does not mean that many will not enjoy this version.  For many will.  Fans of true suspense crime novels won't find real depth found in other noted authors of same genre (Robb, Grafton, Etc.) - but is a fairly good attempt.The issues lie with presentation (style) moreso than premise.  The novella is riddled with errors related to grammar, punctuation, character development and presence, Point of View, and story arc development.Punctuation:  overuse of exhuberance (!) where illfiting at times, extra floating dialogue quotes at end of paragraph without dialogue, other than dialogue bits (some, not all) incorrectly punctuated, some dialogue missing punctuation related to tags, missing or incorrect punctuation.  Dialogue paragraphs with same speaker punctuated incorrectly (though very few will know such.)Formatting is still a bit of an issue as there are some pages where paragraph breaks are so many only two small paragraphs fit on page.  I do not include format issues in star rating as I know that (at times) formatting is amazon conversion issue from downloaning - rather than writer issue.  However, it appears as if the manuscript was originally typed double spaced and when hitting double return between paragraph breaks (which would then be 4 lines, rather than customary 2) there was an overabundance of spaces.  If that is case a simple full document conversion to single spacing prior to downloading should clear up format issues like that.Grammar:  wrong words used - corn rolls (should be rows) to describe ME hair, make on (should be one) take - there are several such errors - but you get the idea on that.  Past tense and present tense switches in sentences and paragraphs was frequent.  Some may be stylistic choice of writer and happens - but not with such frequency as seen in the work.  Some subject/verbs were not grammatically correct - plural nouns get plural verbs,  etc.POV:  I origionally was going to forgive the first few POV switches as character related fleshing.  But, when the POV for many of the characters switched between third person and first person (in same paragraph) I realized it was author error, NOT character voice.  It is possible to have a character think to self in first while rest of tale told in third - but only if the writer understands the fine line and can convey properly.  In this installment of series (in author defense this is first in series and she may have worked this issue out in later works) the author has no grasp of what POV she is using and how to use properly.  One POV is best for the whole work until such time as skill is developed well enough that conveyance and reading are not stilted for reader.Character issues:  Trace was intergral character and partner in training,  then he just (all but) disappeared about half way through book in order for the ""love"" plot device to develop.  Bob was FBI partner that was there for a blink, disappeared for the same reason as Trace, then popped in near end without adding ANYTHING to storyline.  It would have served better to leave Bob out and just send 1 FBI agent to work case as Bob did nothing but add an inconsistency to story line (detail on that next) .  Press was well developed and Trace fairly so (even though underused)  as was female agent.Inconsistencies:Chapter 11 - Press and Trace left interview with Moira - they climbed in the beater car and drove away...fine, until the reader turns the page and Press puts key in ignition, turns it and gets the smoke plume.Chapter 27 - title states day 4 time:  10 AM - yet the first paragraph has press and agent arriving at house ""that evening.""Chapter 28 - title states day 5 at 9:15 AM - Bob tells Rachel he will be in that night and see her next morning.  However,  he does not show up until day 7, several chapters later.There were more issues related to each listed, but you get idea.  I apologize for length, I write long - though typically not thus much.  However, I viewed a comment by author wherein she stated that a review was not really fair to those reading it (or to her I surmise) without specifics so she could fix errors.  Though some of the word issues and punctuation are not a big deal and frequqntly missed - the gross errors (POV and story arc inconsistencies) should not require reviewer intervention for correction. They should have been caught by writer or her editor as they are glaring.As stated in beginning, many will enjoy this novella. Though predictible and even with errors it is an okay read.  If there were not so many errors, I would have awarded more stars.Christine",1,0,0.637007078,0.09552445300000001,NC
2798,2798,"I absolutely agree with the reviewer who said that the author of this book had a great premise but a poor execution.  I was very intrigued by the first couple of chapters, but as the story wore on, my interest and patience flagged.This book introduces Preston 'Press' Andrews.  After the initial engaging description of the crime and its perpetrator, we are led into 'timeline' chapters.  By chapter 14 we are not even 12 hours removed from the beginning of Preston's part of the story, but we have been 'treated' to agonizing and saccharine descriptions of this apparent super hero/detective, and yet very little about the actual crime investigation.  We know how tall Preston is and how much he weighs, the color of his eyes and hair, how muscular he is, how he dresses in Armani apparel and Italian leather loafers, how wealthy he is, how amazing he is...but still humble, how his nickname around the precinct is 'Super Dick' (tee-hee!) because he can solve ANY crime, how beautiful his sister is, how she has long, long legs, about her bra-less breasts (these points noticed by Preston himself...ewwwww), and pretty much how superior Detective Andrews is to all the mere mortals around him.We also get to know a tiny bit about Preston's new partner, Trace Evans ('Press' and Trace...those are not names, they are verbs).  Trace is a new detective, but is treated like a fresh out of the academy rookie beat cop.  Preston looks for signs that Trace is going to be sick at the sight of the victim's body.  Although I am far from an expert on police matters, I was under the impression that it takes a while to work up to being a detective, and by the time a police officer has achieved this designation they have probably already seen their fair share of gruesome sights.  Apparently this is not so in Trace's case.  It seems it is up to Preston to take young Evans under his wing and show him the ABC's of police work, while simultaneously looking like a GQ model, comforting all the rich people in town, making amends with (and surreptitiously leering at) his sister, navigating an amicable break up with his girlfriend (amicable in large part due to how fabulous 'Press' is), and finally, getting the upper hand in an ongoing feud with the big, bad meany Motor Pool officer in charge (insert dramatic music here).Does this sound tedious?  If so, imagine slogging through this mire the entire first half of the book.That's as far as I got.  I deleted this from my device at 54% as I surmised that a great deal more of the text would likely deal with the author's worship of her protagonist rather than the exploration of who committed the crime and why.  I sensed there would likely be some silly wrap up of the mystery with...you guessed it!...'Press' coming out the hero.  No thanks, I'll pass.",1,0,0.59826087,-0.023631713999999998,NC

2802,2802,"Caleb is hired by old friend Steve Peterson to keep tabs on Blake Sera, a former model, and now linked to Rube, a rather shady character. Caleb falls for Blake, literally when he meets her on the beach in front of one Rube's properties. But things are not what they seem between Blake and Rube as Caleb soon discovers. Blake is blissfully unaware of Caleb's true reason for being with her, although she is uneasy that Rube has left. That in itself is not unusual, but the events leading up to his disappearance are.On the whole I enjoyed the book. It is an easy read, although there are some grammatical errors - it is not 'off of' but 'off'. Also it's your conscience not conscious. There were some misused words - you're for your, but because they weren't consistent they didn't detract too terribly much.Some things that niggled at me - Blake runs with a certain crowd and none of them really know her relationship with Rube, but she meets Caleb and spills the beans. I get falling in love (my husband and I got engaged a week after meeting) but for someone who has kept that specific hand of cards close to her chest, I am surprised by her candour so early in the narrative.Also, Caleb is ex-special forces. He is also 'on the job'. How then does he sleep through Blake getting up in the morning, putting coffee next to his bed and taking a shower in the next room? This is a gripe I have about many books, not just this one - the ability of the main character to sleep the sleep of the dead in a strange place. Not buying it - almost everyone I know doesn't sleep well when (a) they are in a strange place and (b) if they know they have to wake up for a special event. So how much more a special forces man?The story was predictable, but because it was well written, and sweet I was willing to overlook that.

2805,2805,"This is the second installment in the ""Journey to Nyorfias"" series. GRAVITY picks up not too long after book 1, ""Convergence""end. Rett is a Sgt. in a Nyorfias elite commando group, F-troup and their orders are to travel to the sister planet of Epnoce with the rest of the 2023rd to try and defeat the Yixolyrn Coalition, an alien race, once and for all. The planet Epnoce seems to be against them with its harsh climate and heavy gravity, but Rett is affected by more than planetary anomalies. Her ego-merge Pam is gone, her sister and lover are acting strange and she's running into problems with her long-time friend and commander, Evetez.  Everything appears to be against her and Rett is struggling to cope with adversity while keeping up with training in the heavier gravity.What Rett doesn't release, however, is that she is a major player in the game of balance between light vs. dark in the universe. The deity of this universe, Pheasyce, is forced to watch as Rett is stripped of support from everyone who cares about her. Rett must reach deep within herself and rise above the confusion and depression that threatens to overwhelm her or the deity, Xonomer, will win.The author does an excellent job of letting the reader inside Rett's head to feel her outrage as she struggles to keep it together to her utter dismay as one thing after another is stacked against her.  Her combat skills are legendary, but is it because of love and respect of the soldiers under her command that would willingly die for her or is she a lone wolf who needs no one's support to accomplish the impossible?The book has its fair share of intense battles against the Yixolyrn Coalition including an epic battle of wills between Rett and her old nemesis, Avok. There is a lot more going on in this book besides battles to defeat an evil enemy. To say any more would be too much of a spoiler, but suffice it to say, T.M.

It offers up plenty of laughs, a great deal of chuckles, while being liberally sprinkled with head scratching ""wha?"". Frankly there is little point to the story other than offering some comedy, but that might be what the author was going for. I think this one might be ""you either get it....or you don't"" Maybe I just don't, but I would still recommend you read this oddball for yourself.

2807,2807,"I enjoyed this book, but it took me forever to read. Not because it was boring or uninteresting, because that is certainly not the fact, but for two reasons:1) The names of the characters were hard to digest, especially since the Reborn-in-Jesus family are the main characters in the book. Yes, that's their last name, so you can just imagine what their first names were like. It got a little confusing and I kept thinking that I really needed a character sheet so I could keep them all straight. Plus it got a little tedious as you went through with such long names.2) The author obviously enjoyed the use of his thesaurus while writing this book. Which is an odd thing for me to say considering I love big words and use them often. There were an exceptional amount in this book and even I spent a lot of time looking things up in the dictionary because I had never heard of the words before.The book is several stories over a period of time dealing with the Reborn-in-Jesus family and the little planet that they live on. As I said before, I really enjoyed the stories and was excited to find that their is a sequel to this book, one I plan on reading in the near future - though the description of it seems like it will be more about two of the children instead of the family as a whole.I recommend you read this book ... just make sure you have the dictionary downloaded on your Kindle :)",1,1,0.566308244,0.710872163,NC

She over comes a bad marriage and divorce to become a successful author and find her dream man and to live a happily ever after.  I love Dana and Edward, the kids are totally cute.  I like this story because the characters where never wishy-washy about their feelings for one another.  They knew they loved each other and stayed true through all the crazy fans that they both had.  I like the fact that the author never gave the characters any hang ups about their past to prevent a future. Dana and Edward seem like real people and I can relate to them.The story is worth way more then the 99 cents.  If you are looking for a complicated love story then this not for you.

I dont know why but theyre either overlooked or overused. And the guy can never seem to wrap his head around the idea of someone else's children.

Jagger Brodie would love to get to know Tabby better, then opportunity knocks in the form of a snow storm.I really liked the characters in this story they are all extremely well developed and interesting I also liked that the four friends all had such different personalities yet complimented one another so well.

The characters' flaws and one-note characterization, kept me at a distance as they tried, but failed to develop and connect with each other emotionally, and engage the reader, in any truly satisfying, believable way.  In fact, at several points, they were unlikeable enough to keep each other, and me, at a distance.  I wanted to care about them, but could not.By 3/4's of the way through, I was antsy for the story to reach a climax, come to a resolution,  and end.

Delicately dancing between an ideal future & a carbon footprint troubled present, this novel combines ecology & technology in a way I never imagined possible, while staying true to what history has taught us: humans repeat cycles of learning & cycles of destruction.The characters are well-developed and honest. Most reveal several layers (not just the primary characters) while showing true emotions throughout the story: from our tendency to judge people as good or bad based on how they make us feel to the fatigue that comes at the end of an arduous journey that seems to have been in vain. The plot is well-planned and flows seemingly effortlessly towards a conclusion that cannot be predicted, utilizing nicely done transistions to form a very cohesive dual-storyline.Flora's story is one of hope & faith.

I was a little afraid that style might trump plot development or that the book might turn to preaching or get hokey in some way. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the deeper I got into the book, the more engaging it was. The parallel stories both picked up the pace and developed into excellent mysteries that kept me engrossed the whole time. Better yet, the pacing in both stories were well matched throughout, such that I was equally eager in either story to find out what was going to happen next and torn whenever it switched because I wanted to continue both at the same time. The best part is that I actually felt the ending lived up to the build up, which often isn't the case. The writing wasn't flawless, and there were definitely a few things that were rather elaborated on that felt a little unnecessary, but in the end the good points far exceeded any shortcomings and for the next day after finishing I kept looking forward to picking it back up and then realizing I had already finished.

I liked most of the characters. Some errors a copy editors would've caught, but nothing truly annoying. I thought about it while I was not reading it which is always a Good Thing.The twist at the end was not unexpected -- I saw it coming very early on, after Kandari's first overly long preachy lecture. Damn. Even though I knew it was inevitable, I was still interested enough in the characters to want to see what happened and how things were resolved. I sort of bought the technology that enabled it all, but not that it would happen at that level within the next 50 years (I can't really get into what, exactly, I didn't buy because that would involve spoilers).And whatever happened to Flora's father? And there was never a rationale for what Romulus did -- what was the purpose? What did he have to gain?

The dazzling world of Wall Street comes to life as we enter the world of the Dahlen family in the 1950's and their journey into the 1980's. It is a stunning portrait of a family obsessed with love, money and fear. A family rich in wealth yet devoid of emotional stability and love. A family that is headed down an unforeseen path of great wealth and prosperity. A family full of secrets and betrayal on a collision course of emotional upheaval and destruction.Deedee Dahlen was born with the proverbial ""Silver Spoon"" in her mouth. A million dollar heiress who learns that money can't protect her from the trials and tribulations of life.Lana Bantry was born poor and never knew her father as a child. She is strong and tenacious and her story reflects a time when women were struggling for their rightful place in the business world. She is fueled by anger and resentment that keeps her emotionally void of love in her life.Slash Steiner was adopted from an orphanage by a wonderful family and always vowed that he would be rich one day. He is determined and strong yet struggles to find his place in the business world as well as in the Dahlen family.The characters are brought to life by the tremendously descriptive writing as you take on their journey as they progress and grow throughout the story. The dialogue between characters is real and believable and the historical events of the time period are woven into the story with compassion and ease.This is a highly charged emotional story that spans decades of the Dahlen family. It is fast paced and full of twists and turns that will keep you engaged in the story. It is a tale of a family that is perceived to the outside world as having it all yet behind closed doors face tremendous hardship, scandal and ultimately love and survival.I highly recommend this book to all readers; I totally enjoyed and was swept away with the story.",1,1,0.585751979,0.7238346529999999,NC

2843,2843,"I just finished reading Yellow Zone, and I have to agree with mjp and Liz's reviews. I have read several of Ms. Druga's works, and this one just wasn't as good as some of her others. That said, had I read this book before any of her others, I may well have given it 5 stars. I rated it 4 stars in comparison with her other books, such as I'll Cry Alone and Dust. The main reason that I liked those stories better than this one is that the reader gets to know the leading character much more intimately than in this book. Because this book in written in the style of a Journal, through individual journal entries, it didn't really lend to intimate examination of the characters. Several different characters contribute to the Journal, and the story evolves through each individual's eyes and thoughts. Ms. Druga's other stories (at least those that I have read so far) are told in the narrative style by the main character. So, not only do you get the events as they are occurring, but the narrator's thoughts as well, which gives the reader more indepth knowledge of the character, which in turn makes you feel like you know them.Now to the actual story: Yellow Zone is about a terror attack on the country, which entails the release of a deadly and fast moving virus. People are dying en masse, and authorities quarantine states that are affected. Those who do not sicken are gathered together and sent to camps, seemingly for their own protection. When Jen (the main character) and those with her realize that this might not be the case, they make plans to escape the camp, fleeing to a farm that is owned by one in their group. Once there, they learn that the country is still under ""attack,"" as other countries try to eradicate the survivors, and with them the virus. When a transmission comes via radio that help is available, they must decide if it is legitimate, and if they want to take a chance by responding.As with the other books I have read by the author, I read this fairly quickly because I couldn't put it down! The events that occurred kept the book fast-paced, and I needed to know what was going to happen next! I definitely recommend reading this one.",1,1,0.585746102,0.654788418,NC

Inner Demons was a step into the darker direction of the Peachville Witches. The first book didn't get too crazy into magic much until the end, this book started our right away with the magic and it kept getting deeper and darker as the book progressed.I am very interested in Morgyn, and I am not sure if we will learn more about or not with what happened in this book. But I am curious to see what her and Jackson's relationship really was like, and speaking of Jackson. Man, so hot! His mysterious edge to him, and you always know he is somewhere watching over you, it just makes him dreamy. His story I am very anxious to find out about, but with the way that this book ended I hope that the next book we will get his back story.I am interested to see what happens with the girls who make their initiation into the witches order. I wonder if Harper can really help them, or are they stuck the way they are forever? There wasn't one thing I didn't like about this book, I loved the writing style, everything flowed very nicely, and I have to say I am a fan of shorter chapters, because I feel like it helps me read faster ;) I loved this book, and I am so glad I have the next one to read right away. If you start reading this series, buy each book because you will not want to stop reading once you have finished one book!!

2859,2859,"This was like one of those Victorian Christmas romances, very common if you enjoy historical romances. Usually, under Christmas, the romance series like Harlequin and Mills&Boon; ask to their more important authors to write a Christmas story; these stories are always sweet more than passionate, and they have, of course, an happily ever after. But more than that, for all the novel, you are never worried for your heroes, since you are sure they are enjoying a Seasonal romance with you and they will be happy in the end.This is it for Thomas and Andrew; when the novel starts Thomas is the disowned son of a duke who can barely afford a room at the University Club. Most of the time he is helped by his good friend Andrew, the son of a wealthy merchant. Not that at Thomas cares much that his friend his not nobility, and they really are tight, someone could say as tight as lovers. But Thomas is really nave, and he has never questioned Andrew's attachment. On the other side Andrew is well aware to be in love with Thomas, but for the sake of their friendship, he has never said a word.I think Andrew's move to have the both of them spending Christmas with Thomas's family was more something he did for Thomas. He convinced his friend he wanted to see how Christmas season is in a country Manor House, but to me it seemed he wanted for Thomas to reconcile with his family, after he ran away 6 years before to avoid to marry the woman picked by his father.From the moment they arrive, to discover that in the last 3 years there was not Christmas at the house due to the mourning for Thomas's sister in love passing, to the time they will leave, everything will change. Without much drama, and I would daresay, not much surprise, Thomas will realize his interest in Andrew is more than a simple friendship, and when Andrew will finally admit his own feelings, Thomas is more than ready to look at his friend with different eyes. Their love story is sweet and the happily ever after smells of all the good things you can eat at Christmas. I will not say it's an impossible ending, I learned long ago few example of same sex happily ever after were possible, so I will sit down, and enjoy the comfortable and warm feeling of this novel.",1,1,0.5514223189999999,0.32713347800000003,NC

Annie is moved to follow the rainbow to find the gold so that she can give it to her father.  She gets lost and frightened, but through this adventure, learns some very valuable lessons.This is a wonderful tale for children and adults alike.

2863,2863,"I'd never read a picture book on my kindle before, so when this children's picture book was offered as a free download I thought I'd like to try. The story's short and sweet--little Annie Mouse wants to find the rainbow's secret gold to give to her father, but learns where real treasure lies when she gets lost. The story's ideal for reading to and sharing with young children, encouraging them to learn to value themselves. It's the fourth Annie Mouse book in a series and I expect the others are good too.Poet Charley Barker has written a pleasing poem given in full at the story's end. The lyrical quest of an adult for rainbow's end is nicely mirrored in a child's fear of thunderstorms and of being lost. Simple illustrations by Alicia Agnew carry the mix of text and dialog forwards across page boundaries (though I wished I could have seen the double-page spreads of LO and VE painted across the sky--my kindle has its limitations). In black-and-white the pictures give a feel of pencil drawings and characters with clearly drawn emotions--I'm guessing they're even more impressive in color on real paper.I'd say I enjoyed my first kindle picture book, and this one was a good one to try. But I'd still prefer paper and genuine pages and color. If you're looking for a sweet tale to teach a small child how much they are valued and loved, this book is ideal.Disclosure: I learned from the author that this book was available free.

2871,2871,"The hauntingly alien world that author Mark Paul Jacobs has created for us, is almost itself a character within his story. Here, in this rugged yet bountiful landscape, even time is unfamiliar. The hardy populations who dwell in 'The Yaakmen of Tyrie' have mastered survival, civilization, stunningly imaginative beasts, and they mark time by the passage of twin moons. Neither the men, nor the beasts, are brutish. This is not a prehistoric tale. There is a sense of government, carefully refined. There is a structure of honor, and service, that a great history has woven into the fabric of life. These are intricately crafted characters--equal to the vast landscape. Jacobs has created a world that displays itself beautifully.Pleasurable as it is to discover an author who can make something alien feel so familiar, there is so much more to this tale than a well-written adventure. There is a mystery in the origins of these people. There are secrets, revealed to them in the same moments they are revealed to us; there are secrets that are very dangerous to uncover. It will take all the strength of a brave few, to wander beyond what they know, to follow clues they could find more about themselves beyond the vast mountain ranges they have never crossed.For all the beauty we have discovered in reading the entire tale, the conclusion is only a window at last, showing us there is something vast and even greater in pages to come.",1,1,0.5827338129999999,0.860911271,NC
2872,2872,"William L.K. Give us a world that blends the world we know with a totally foreign world far from our own, but totally believable.  Blending two different stories together, one from our time and another which could be our future, our past, or another dimension all-together, it doesn't really matter.The short first part of a three part saga, starts out with Becki, a young girl whose is tied to a tree during a giant storm. A large creature has the Czar of Stritonoly in its grip, tearing into his flesh. A persistent beeping sound fills Becki's head and she passes out. So begins the complex story of a royal family living on a purple planet, made rich by the slave labor of a strange race called the Acidel.The humans in the story are both gathered around a comatose girl named Becki, and the Czar of Stritonoly and his wife and two children. The story has two parts because the characters are living simultaneous lives in the two worlds with each of their actions influencing the different worlds.Becki has a drug addiction in both worlds and it causes her to skip between her differing personalities.  Her brother Dimitri in the purple world, is addicted to the sweat of the Acidel, an innocent species who work on Stritonoly. What the author has done so brilliantly, is to blend the two worlds. The Acidel have pale rubbery skin, and their sweat causes hallucinations.  They are mushrooms in our world, and yet have their own lives in another dimension. One of the main characters is even named Shroomy, a nickname in the drug world for mushrooms.This reminds me of what the native people have always said when asked how they knew the uses for each of the plants.  They claimed that their shamans would go into the spirit world and talk to the plants. I found the author's insight fascinating as he moved between his imaginary worlds, stretching the readers mind in directions in the same way that Carlos Castaneda did In his books, The Teachings of Don Juan.Eye of the Storm leaves us with a giant storm hitting Stritonoly and Becki in a hospital on earth, dying from a drug overdose. Needless to say I stared reading the next book in the series immediately which is Barok's Exodus.

If you don't like action, then this story is not for you; because Lawson is a kick ass kind of man in all the right ways. I also appreciate the concept of how the vampires evolved, they came into being from a past belief of humans who drank the blood of mighty animals they killed to gain their strength (the vampires used this concept to evolve as well); haven't heard of that in any other vamp books. :-) Also, the way a vampire can be killed is like no other I have read about either; and that was a refreshing thing as well.

2874,2874,"Some areas of history are darker than others. Some are written about more than any other topic and become almost clich&eacute;. One area of history that is not neglected but not really focused on is the Roman occupation of Britain. Fiction or nonfiction, this period is very interesting. Elizabeth May approaches this period with a story you'll fall in love with in Roman Sunset.This is not an historical romance. This is not a boring recitation of the history of Britain during Rome's occupation. This is a story of a land finding itself on the threshold of a new era and the turmoil, both internal and external, that accompany epic changes.The Roman Empire is not as strong as it once was. It's presence on the island of Britain is diminishing. Most Romans left are retired veterans who had planned on living out their lives on peaceful farms with their families. As the Empire pulls back its reach, the ones left in Britain find themselves either dead or forced to take up the sword again as the Picts see the weakening of the Romans and look to reclaim what once was theirs as they wreak havoc throughout the land south of Hadrian's Wall.Ms. May does not just tell a tale. She goes into the daily life of a Roman soldier, the thoughts of a retired soldier called back into duty, the grisly acts of the Picts against even the Britains, and the life of a slave trudging through the wilds north of the Wall. A reader cannot help but find themselves in a battle camp smelling the fires, the fear, and the death. The terror of the victim is felt as the Pict searching for them to cut them down. The love of a young couple is not just read about but felt in these powerful words.You won't find this book full of intimate scenes between couples. You won't find gory horror scenes. The battles are scenes descriptive without being too much for the average reader to take it. You won't find it a quick read. It spans about one year in time and covers many miles of activity and many groups of people.I read the kindle version. There were a few formatting issues that is common with kindle, but it is nothing that you would find interfering with your reading.Are you a history lover? Do you like Roman history?

If you read this as a serious romance, it's not very good, but I read it as a farce, a light-hearted jab at historical romance conventions. I've read four of her books and every one of them is similar. They are fast reads, are laugh out loud funny, and will keep you smiling and sighing throughout. There were a few grammar and spelling errors, but not too many.

2879,2879,"My least favorite romances are those in which the happy couple spend too much of the book whingeing on about crap that would be resolved in one sentence if they sat down and had a conversation. I understand that real, deep relationship challenges are harder to develop than ""when he/she finds out ________ he/she won't love me anymore! Wah!"" but it drives me nuts nonetheless.This book is basically entirely organized around a marriage based on deceit and secrets. So the entire time they are engaged in the aforementioned whingeing, of course the author is making sure the reader knows that they really love each other and could forgive the peccadilloes, trysts, lies of ommission, trickery, and other unwholesome acts attributed to their respective spouses. That in itself might seem hard to believe, but whatever.Unfortunately, they don't find out that they could have been honest all along until the last chapter. Yes, that's right- they spent the ENTIRE BOOK deceiving each other, avoiding each other, and otherwise being miserable wretches. Yay!I bought this book because I wanted to see how things turned out for him after he got so royally screwed in the last book.

2880,2880,"**Review of the Audio Book**Description:&lt;B>The Longing&lt;/b> is the story of Kyle Grayson and Amelia Drake, who have both been hurt in the past by people they loved.  They are forced to marry and now they have to learn to trust each other with their secrets and their hearts.The Set-Up:Kyle Grayson is the middle Grayson brother who has run the family mill since his father died.  He lost the woman he thought he was going to marry to his brother, so he is (understandably) very cranky and pretty cynical about love.  Amelia Drake is the daughter of a mill owner and when she was young she was seduced and abandoned by a man who she thought loved her and wanted to marry her.  Now she&#8217;s decided to stay a spinster school teacher because no man would want a wife who isn&#8217;t a virgin.  Due to some unfortunate circumstances, Kyle and Amelia must marry and that&#8217;s where the story really takes off.What I liked:Kyle and Amelia are really interesting, complicated characters who both have A LOT of baggage.  Kyle is not a particularly likeable character in the first book, so it was really great to see him transform over the course of the book, not just in his relationship with Amelia, but also with his brothers.  I liked Amelia&#8217;s sassiness and sense of humor.  This books had a lot of humor which was a pleasant surprise.What I Also Liked:There was a bit of a mystery in this story, which I thought added to the book and helped Kyle and Amelia build their relationship and learn to work together.What I didn&#8217;t Like:The hero and heroine keeping secrets from each other is not my favorite plot device.  I just wanted them to talk to each other! There were so many secrets, it got a little frustrating, but even after saying all that it does make for a compelling read!I listened to the audio version of this book and I thought the narrator (Julia Motyka) did an excellent job portraying all the different characters and conveying the emotion and humor needed for this story.  She's a narrator I'd definitely listen to again!If you&#8217;re looking for a well-written, compelling historical romance (when are those secrets going to come out!?!?), with complex characters with a lot of baggage but also sass and humor and occasional crankiness, then I highly recommend this story!I was offered a copy of the audio book by the author in exchange for an honest review.",1,1,0.5921568629999999,0.6329411770000001,NC

That project is run by Grace Lighthorse, half Irish/ half Ojibwe massage therapist, who wants to use the money to provide handmade comfort blankets for seriously ill children in hospitals.  Dan believes in research and hard scientific data.  Grace believes in the combination of medicine and alternative healing and body work, and in the power of positive thinking to help raise spirits and help immune systems heal. Philosophically,they couldn't be further apart. But the administrator of the grant requires them to work together for three weeks, each to help the other and see what the projects are all about, and then to decide between themselves who should get the money, as legally it cannot be split.As they work together, Dan and Grace find that there's more to the other than lies on the surface, and they also find a very deep attraction that just won't go away.

The storytelling is good, it wasn't too painful to read, but the reactions and story development was ... bland.  There were times when there was just too much detail and times when the details made no sense.  This story felt like it came from a writer in the infancy of their career? Ability?  Either way, I'm not bothering to buy the other books.  These kindle free books are getting so annoying with the continuations.  I think that's why most of them are so bad.  The only book that I can recall that was sensationally good and worth the investment of the 2nd book was by Olivia Cunning, Backstage Pass.

2898,2898,"Revised February 2014The Last Elf of Lanis is the first of four books in the Wealdland series and although the book is not without its flaws (as other reviewers and the author himself have pointed out), it was still a very good and entertaining story in my opinion. More importantly, the book sets the stage for the subsequent novels to come. For me, I thought the concept of the last surviving elf (Iounelle) was pretty original and made me think often what it would be like to be in her shoes. Equally compelling was learning about the archer and his background.  Both Iounelle and the archer were very engaging protagonists that I wanted to learn more about. Their story and interaction was compelling.  The book also contained many interesting supporting characters. I thought Alhrett's and Conniker's animal speak (although not original) was entertaining. Fight scenes were also well written.  Yes, there were some distractions (as other reviewers have noted), including editorial issues that need resolving.However, all in all I really enjoyed this book and all of Mr. hargan's subsequent novels. I believe this was his first fantasy novel and at99 cents is worth the read. His other novels are all very entertaining (I think 20 or so are ultimately planned). You can tell he put a lot of thought into the story.  Overall, The Last Elf is a good book and series to get into. I would recommend.JeffIndieproofreader@gmail.com",1,1,0.631386861,0.557664233,NC

2902,2902,"4****StarsI had read the review for the PRG for Do Unto Others, and was unsure of what Ms Stroud's Devil's Moon would be about. Suffice to say this short novel under 150 pages did not disappoint. Miss Stroud has a great writing style with the POV coming from all her ensemble, so you know what is going on with all of them.Sam Wilson has gotten it right the second time, divorcing the cheerleader Barbie doll first wife, and meeting the love of his life. He has married Jane and they are deeply in love. Enter the ex wife Bambi (yes Bambi), you all know her type, high roller, exquisite, with a black heart. She is the wicked mother of a great son who doesn't deserve any of this, Danny.The title does not tell what the book is about, and you will only `get it' after you read the book. The mystery evolves when Bambi realizes her life is slipping by and she has nothing. Her claim to fame is her beauty, her boobs and her social status, which will all soon be a changing. She is living her life in a bottle of booze and anger, with her unhealthy hatred, and devises a plan to take Jane and Sam down with her.The book is such a quick read as the author takes us down this windy path, during  a month before Christmas. You feel the Holiday spirit of all the cast. Jane's love for the holiday makes every one of her family love it too. She is a bright light for her  husband Sam, her dog Devil and her step son Danny.The hatred in  Bambi permeates the pages, and you are filled with loathing for her. Being in her head, as she rationalizes her feelings is also  hard. She makes some pretty loathsome choices and you are rooting for the good guys.The book was a great read, the only irksome thing for me was the last scene, for Bambi, and I would have liked something more plausible. You will have to let me know what your thoughts are as I will tell you to pick it up, and enjoy.Review by Gloria LakritzSr. Reviewer and Review Chairperson of the Paranormal Romance Guild Review Team",1,1,0.569739953,0.569739953,NC
2903,2903,"Don't mess with a woman and her dog!That's the message from this delightful book by Florida's Rebecca Stroud, a dog lover and outspoken animal welfare advocate who has written numerous other animal stories.I simply loved this tale and lament the fact that I bought it a year ago and only just read it now because of my horrendous TBR list. I shoulda moved it up long ago and would have if I'd known it was this good.Jane Wilson, her husband Sam, their son Danny and their ugly but lovable dog Devil are getting along just fine in Florida until Sam's ex-wife Bambi shows up, bent on revenge and getting rid of Jane. This psycho from hell is a wonderful character and spices things up nicely. The crude language might be a bit too much for some, but it is perfectly within character and suitable for the context of this novel.The writing is superb -- vintage Stroud -- and the editing first class. I think this woman could make a grocery list seem entertaining. The characters are wellrounded, interesting dialogue and just a damn good read.This one is worth 10 stars if I could give it, but five will have to do. A very well written and creative piece of work.

Dr. Sam Wilson is a successful and dedicated Veterinarian in Central Florida.  His ten year marriage to Bambi, a spoiled, self-centered socialite from Tallahassee ended and two and a half years later he marries Jane, and Jane's beloved, big black mix-breed dog named Devil.  Jane is the office manager for a security services company who hates her job as well as her boss.  Bambi is not willing to let Sam off the hook and uses their teen-aged son Danny as leverage. Danny has not accepted Jane in her role as 'Step-mother', and Jane seems to just accept that he never will.The more scotch Bambi consumes, the more devious plots she conjurs up in her mind to disrupt Sam and Jane's lives and hopefully drive a wedge in their marriage.  It is Christmas time and the winter weather of constant rain and cool temperatures lingers for days.  Mysterious events begin occuring around Jane and Sam's home, and Jane is convinced Bambi is behind them.  Sam is convinced she isn't.When Devil disappears, all hell breaks loose.  The mystery deepens with a brutal assault on Jane at an awards ceremony for Danny and some of his classmates at the local country club.  The tension builds page after page and I wanted to jump in and make an arrest . . . but, as I was coming to the end of this beautiful book, I saw there was no need for my action, AUTHOR REBECCA STROUD had it well under control.

Yes it is sad to see a woman descend like she did but what she did to Devil and to Jane was wrong.I loved the relationship between Jane and Sam, the growing relationships between Jane and Danny and Danny and Lisa.

2908,2908,"4.5 starsJane Wilson loves the Christmas season, and she has high hopes for this one, after all she has a wonderful new husband, Sam, and her beloved old dog Devil, a girl couldn't ask for more out of life. Sure she has the world's worst boss, and a job that sucks, and her relationship with her stepson is not the greatest, but Jane is not going to let those few little problems get her down.Unfortunately, it seems Sam's psycho ex-wife Bambi has decided that it's time that Sam realizes what a big mistake he made in divorcing her, and the only thing standing in her way of getting him back is none other than his current goody two shoes wife Jane. Bambi is not about to let that little plain Jane Sam married get in her way, so she sets her twisted mind on her goal, and heaven help anyone or anything that gets in her way.Jane is unprepared for Bambi's truly sick, perverted methods of vindictiveness, but she is determined to convince Sam that Bambi is evil, and will do whatever it takes to protect those she loves.Having not read any of Ms. Stroud's works, I wasn't sure what to expect with this book.  Ms. Stroud did not disappoint, she managed to pack a lot of content into a short, well written book that was full of surprises around every corner. Her characters are varied and we are given a good glimpse into each of their thoughts and feelings.Jane is a bit of a Pollyanna in the beginning. She loves Sam, is willing to try to make it work with his son Danny and put up with his ex-wife Bambi. She doesn't understand why Danny doesn't like her, and while it bothers her, she isn't going to let it get her down. She knows Bambi is a bitch, and she gets frustrated with Sam when he just won't see her for what she is.The constant bright spot in her life has always been her dog Devil, who is getting old but Jane can't imagine life without him. It doesn't take her long to take off those rose colored glasses of hers, and she becomes one strong woman not to be messed with. Her relationship with Danny is difficult and I'm not sure if a little bit of it isn't her fault and a little bit of it isn't Sam's fault.Sam is a good man, he's a vet and loves animals (a plus for Jane and Devil) but does have blinders on when it comes to Danny and Bambi. I didn't understand why it took him so long to see Bambi for what she really was, but he was such a softy that I forgave him.Danny was your typical teen of divorced parents, trying to fit in somewhere and wanting to protect his mom despite her neglect of him. He was a good kid, he could have used a little less coddling from Sam and little more parental guidance but hey, no one is perfect.Bambi was the perfect villainess. That woman had no sense of morals, and she was pretty sure the world revolved around her. She was just so easy to hate and boy, did she come through and not disappoint in that department.This is a short book and I read it in about 3 hours, but don't be fooled, even though it is short it packs a wallop. Reader be warned, there is some R rated language, some violence and a few scenes of animal abuse, none of it over the top, but if the F word bothers, this might not be the book for you.I'm not sure what it says about me, but I loved every moment. I ran the entire roller coaster of emotions from love, hate, fright and tears and was sad to say goodbye to Jane, Sam, Danny and Devil when it ended. If you like a book with a strong heroine, a real nasty villain and a big ole softy dog, this book is for you.Reviewed as a Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild Dual Reviews Team",1,1,0.555989583,0.333984375,NC

I opened this book yesterday intending to read 2 maybe 3 chapters, but suddenly found myself a bit over 60% in with a family clamoring for their dinner.  Immediately after doing the serving & clearing up, I sat back down and literally devoured the rest of this story.  It is shorter then King so you can easily finish in a day, his took me a week.The main characters in this book are mostly extremely likeable as well as believable.  They are:Sam- a kindhearted, veterinarian who is also Jane's husband.  This is a second attempt at matrimony for both and a very happy one.Jane- wife of Sam who works at a really crappy job for Randall a basket case, whiner, loser boss, but volunteers at the local animal shelter as well.Devil- Jane's getting older, ugly, but much beloved dog who is embraced by the whole family.Danny- son of Sam and Bambi who I will describe later and is the pretty typical 17 yr old child of divorced parents when one parent is acrimonious and can't move on.  Conflicted and afraid to let his step-mom Jane too far into his life.And then there is Bambi- a foul mouthed southern belle, piece of nasty work who believes the sun rises and sets on her or at least it should.  She cannot cope with having been replaced by Jane as Sam's wife feeling Jane is inferior to her and becomes seriously unbalanced with a severe drinking problem to boot.This story allows us to follow this dysfunctional family through a period of time and watch as one women falls apart and crumbles, yet does not change while the rest struggle to form a cohesive, loving family unit.  It is griping, suspenseful even though you know who the bad guy (gal) is almost immediately and will pull you along from the very first word written on the page.I recommend you give this one a chance.",1,1,0.614173228,0.614173228,NC

You know who the killer is almost from the very beginning. Even though the author attempts to throw off who the real killer is, it is a poor and lame attempt. The main character Tyler seems to gain super human strength and intelligence at times. If it wasn't for his ""intuition"" and sudden knowledge of things he had no previous knowledge of a few chapters previously, then there would be no way for him to ""solve"" the murders. The portrayal of the police is laughable at times. They're idiotic morons when the author needs them to be and super sleuths when he needs the story to move forward.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that Edwin's talents also lie is more serious fiction as well, as Cuentos shows.Cuentos is a collection of short stories that entertain you starting with vampires and ending with a device that can change the Universe. In between, you see a few more vampires, a few stories of ghosts and cannibals and then he ends the book with a Science Fiction collection that contains clones, colonization, and a &#34;vacation&#34; through the mind of someone so completely insane that nine other therapists have either become trapped in his mind... or have been eaten. I'll let you decide which.I highly recommend this for anyone who wants something a little darker but still fun. Edwin has a unique writing style that shines through all of his stories, and he finds a way to make you laugh even when you know that you really shouldn't be laughing at what happened.

Mr. Stark is a compelling storyteller with a unique way of painting a scene. There are no tired old clich&eacute;s in here. I loved almost all of the stories. The creativity displayed by this writer is phenomenal. I really liked the first story, where a young man goes hunting cans to fund a new video game and finds much more than he bargained for, and the sci-fi surprised me by being clever, eloquent, and enjoyable. I cannot honestly say that I liked &#34;The Revenant' or &#34;Hate the Future,&#34; but this is not because they are badly written. They are too gory and upsetting for my taste. In fact, the writing is so strong, it makes the gore and suffering unendurably vivid. So, if you're looking for some clever, fantastic stories, check out this collection. Just be sure to bring your iron stomach... or skip those two in the middle. Overall, well done, Mr. Stark. Excellent effort. Five stars.",1,1,0.6737288140000001,0.782485876,NC
2921,2921,I did not write a review on the 1st book of the series Divine Grace because I think 31 reviews is enough .  I did enjoy the book but I can see where some people may have issues with the horse porn (as they called it) and the characters expressing I love you so quickly.  Lets just remember here people its called fiction for a reason.  Ok now that I'm done with my little rant I wanted to say after reading all the books of this series I love Rachel and Eli story so much.  I dont know if Heather Rainier ever reads the reviews but she has made a life long fan out of me. I love how rachel and eli must over come their problems and then the problems get worst before they get better (just like most normal people).  I think everyone should try this series because I past by it several times and now I'm a huge fan.,1,1,0.5977011489999999,0.798850575,NC
2922,2922,"The story grabs the reader right from the start.  The characters are all very well developed.  You find yourself rooting for the main character.  A young doctor who has a strong sense of right and wrong.  Believes that the truth must always be told.. even if it costs him his career.  The protagonist in the story.. uses this flaw to his advantage to promote his OWN career.  (naturally)The first half of the book deals mainly with developing the characters.. and embroiling them in a mystery that they know they MUST find out the truth.  Once the truth is finally found and revealed.. the story picks up the pace.. and the reader finds themselves on the ""Wheeeeeee"" part of the roller coaster!Ken McClure certainly understands bureaucrats. He writes them so well! How something that COULD easily be contained.. is NOT .. due to their ineptitude.  That's what makes this story so believable.  One can easily deduce what SHOULD be done.. and due to some government officials needing to cover their backsides.. many will die or be severely impacted.If you have an interest in the black plague.. this book needs to be on your reading list!

2923,2923,"I tried the sample of ""When My Mind Wanders,"" then bought the book, then bought three more and that was just yesterday. Kirkland is genuinely humorous and reading his columns (chapters) are breezy and enjoyable, a great way to spend an evening or a train ride or a summer's afternoon at the beach. He IS very much like Dave Barry for those of your have read Dave before ""Dave Barry Turns 40,"" his heyday.I will say that Kirkland is more for us middle-aged married guys (and gals, yes, ""gals"") than the under-30 crowd.

2924,2924,"Did you ever buy a book that was so good, you couldn't wait to get to the end, and then unhappy that the end meant that it was over? Well, it's been rare for me, but Kirkland (my Canadian Dave Barry - a title which I'm going to make stick) is that rare humorist, now novelist, who takes day-to-day activities or ""catastrophes"" and sees the humor or puts the humor in them.You start reading, and one blog or column (he does both) just kinda runs into another and, before you know it, it's over. Not that you can't read them again, but this isn't like mindless movies where you can let your mind wander and if your comprehension was good the first time, rereading just doesn't give the same kick as the first time through.Well, that's Gordon Kirkland. I've written a few blogs like his - like MY angiogram and worse - but the very thought of being this prolific AND consistent is mind-boggling. What most of us learn - yes, learn from Kirkland is that we've basically lived similar lives if taken from a daily perspective, and we can relate. Lord knows, the best I've ever done is two pack abs which then ended up as 24 ounces of fat (be my guest, Gordon). I've been in a hospital - 7 weeks in fact - where my 2 AM nurse looked like Godzilla, but with a little morphine drip became Anne Blythe (I'm old! which says something for the care Godzilla and a few questionable doctors actually gave me).So, thanks Gordon. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to afford catching up to your cornucopia's output of humor, but I'd be willing to learn to budget for them ... as soon as my wife explains the principles.EW",1,1,0.610644258,0.902661065,NC

Seriously???The dialog was stiff and very simple.  It was connect-the-dots conversations.  B-O-R-I-N-G!We had an emotionally unstable/abusive hero.  Several times during the story he went from normal conversation to raging, (usually at our heroine) and back again in the space of moments all the while physically abusing our poor heroine.Our heroine was a rather simplistic person...and very flat emotionally...which was a good thing since she didn't seem to mind (or even notice) the abuse.The author couldn't keep track of her own plot.  First our hero knows all the heroine's secrets...she tells him point blank...and he doesn't care, he just loves our heroine! (ahh)  Then, he's stunned (and raging [Seeing a pattern?]) to learn those same secrets later in the book.Story/plot is jerky and doesn't flow, jumping from point to point.  I think we could see how much the author wrote in one day by the plot jumps, she seemed to loose track of where she was going halfway through a scene.I just couldn't get myself to care about any of the characters.  They are all so one dimensional and flat.  Their personalities, their conversations, their emotions (even when raging) were just so...flat.The author had no understanding about 1800's medical practices.  A *Duchess* going to the doctor's office(!?) and waiting in a waiting room(!?!) and then our hero in a rage (you MUST see the pattern by now!) and barging into the exam room(!?!?!).  [And unless the doctor is blind and deaf and the exam room is the size of a football stadium I can't believe he wouldn't notice the hero 'slamming and yelling' as he raged.]And, our villain. You could tell where the author was trying to go and the sense of dread she was trying to create...I just wish she would have followed through and delivered it...but alas, our villain was flat and unimaginative and...well stupid.  I kept expecting her to stomp her foot and hold her breath to get her own way.All in all, if this book hadn't been free I would have demanded my money back.  As it is, I wish I could demand my time back.  What I don't understand is the 4 and 5 star reviews.  This was so poorly written I can only implore the author to take a few English classes, take several writing classes, buy some good history books and learn how to plot out a book.

I love stories about lovers who have been separated and find each other again. I love stories about love that doesn't die, even when the lovers cannot be together--and in this case, you get two for the price of one.  I also like that the story has a mean girl--Ms. McClure's mean girls always add so much interest to the story, whether their role is lengthy or brief.

Mr. Shaw has never been properly diagnosed, hospitalized, or is he medicated.This is truly a book of what it really feels like, and the racing thoughts and moods that goes through ones mind.It is a book that will ring true for any sufferer of mental illness or loved one of someone who is afflicted for it mirrors the darkest recesses of the mind- it says what the mentally ill have always tried to put in words but were too confused to do so.It says that you are not alone.(And, YOU, Mr. Shaw, are not alone, either).

I was pleased by the post-apocalyptic adventure and romance.The disaster is that earth is hit by a huge meteor shower that has a profound affect on the topography as well as the occupants so that by three hundred years later advanced technology is a thing of the past throwing society back into the Middle Ages.  Life is about survival mostly.  It also has an affect on the people and animals in that mutations take place causing there to become a class system of 'normals'- people showing no mutation and 'mutah's- those who show evidence of mutation.  There are 'cleanses' where the normals wipe out any mutahs they come across.Atty is a mutant and lives in a walled village made up of mutahs.  She is special in that she is the only female in the hunter caste and has a rare gift with weaponry particularly her bow so that she is able to successfully bring in meat even when other hunters come back unsuccessful.  One day she comes back to find that her mother and sister- the last of her family- are missing and presumed dead.  That night a band of soldiers- cleaners- burst into their village and begin slaughtering her people.  She uses her special gift to stop the slaughter and kills sixteen of them before a larger party of soldiers come.  Atty is captured and restrained.  The leader does not kill her like she anticipates, but he is intrigued by her ability and decides to take her captive and force her to teach his men.  In return, he will let the rest of her people live.Yulen is the Battle Lord for his compound.  He hates the mutah because they killed his father, but he decides to spare this mutah girl who decimated his troops in an astounding show of skill. He refuses to admit that he is attracted to her though his old friend and adviser sees right through him.  On the long journey back to his compound and the adventures they have on the journey, Yulen begins to learn how wrong he has been in his assumptions about the mutah in general and with Atty in specific.  He comes to care for her and now is determined that he wants her for his own.  It helps that her only mutation is her beautiful blue hair, but also her that he takes the time to really know her.  All is not easy in that his men particularly his second in command are still suspicious and even though they grudgingly admit that she's good with her bow he will always have a hard time convincing his people to accept her.The rest of the book is rather exciting.  At one point, I was flying through the pages to see what would come next and yet at another point, I was even reaching for a tissue.To be enjoyable, there is a need to suspend belief and treat this as more of a fantasy than a clear cut dystopian.  It is gritty and harsh in its environment and people, but it is also romantic too.  There were a few twists in the plot that really made things interesting.  The pace was pretty good.The characters were enjoyable though there were only a few described in depth.  I really liked Yulen, Atty and the doctor.Enjoyable read for either those who enjoy historical style fantasy stuff or for those who enjoy post-apocalyptic.",1,1,0.541666667,0.6791666670000001,NC
2957,2957,"I so enjoyed this book. I have read the historical reports of how the Danish people all worke together to save the some 7,000 living in Denmark. Hitler had promised that even though they occupied the country he would not harm their Jewish people. He broke his promise and in just 48 hours the Danish people hid the Jew,s or got them across the sea to Sweden. Because they did the right thing only a few hundred were captured, that was bad but had they done nothing most would have been lost.This story involves a family with twin 11yr olds, Peter and Elise. Peter's best friend is Jewish. Peter's unclehas a fishing business and is working for the underground. When the time comes it is such an exciting story of strength and courage you cannot put it down. The rescue comes at a great cost but also reminds us that for evil to win good people do nothing. The Danish people did something.The children were also training carrier pigeons at the time to race and carry messages. They had some close calls with the Nazi's and could have gotten into big trouble as everything was so closely watched at the times. I don't want to tell you much more as it is such and exciting read and I would spoil it for you.This should be a must read for everyone.",1,1,0.573705179,0.6980411679999999,NC
2958,2958,"LIPS THAT TOUCH MINE was a really good story that showed how love developed from an attraction of opposites. Boyd was a handsome, laid back, powerful man (who didn't mind using his physical strength to solve problems in his saloon) and didn't believe he would ever love anybody enough to marry them. Claire was a beautiful, strong-minded, compassionate woman who had finally escaped an abusive husband (when he drowned) and never wanted to get married again.  She associated alcohol with every domestic problem and when she decided to get every saloon in town closed down, she particularly targeted Boyd's saloon because it was across the street from her boarding house and the noise was chasing away all her boarders.This book was very well written and well edited and was a great addition to the other Grayson Brother's books. The characters practically leapt from the pages, they seemed so alive. The dialogues were authentic and gave me both smiles and tears. (I was especially affected by the scenes that dealt with domestic violence because I used to be a counselor for women who were victims of it.) The imagery was exceptionally good and I found it very easy to get into the story.This book really touched my emotions and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

2964,2964,"Liked the book but felt that the love (lust) began too soon and lacked the development I would have liked to see.  I found it unrealistic that a woman, a little girl, a young boy, and four ""aunts"" traveling together and settling in to a new towm would not have aroused more suspicion.  I could not believe that Faith married Duke without telling him the truth.  Where was her faith in him?  His gifts to her were beyond comprehension - building walls in her house, buying lovely gowns, parasols, etc.  Couldn't quite understand why Faith's Mom would live the way she did and not try to get out of her situation.  Hard to believe she would turn down a marriage proposal to save a man's career.  Duke was a little bit too good to be true.  The aunts all finding love so quickly is also unrealistic....but I guess it worked for the author's purpose in bringing the story to an end.  Adam and Rebecca are too young to be experiencing the feelings they are for one another and it was tacky describing the scene they saw between Iris and Patrick.  The sex scenes are too descriptive.

My grandpa used to say it was a show about everything and nothing. My Life on Craigslist reminds me of that show. We all know Seinfeld was a huge hit and it's easy to see why this book has gotten so much praise. Emily Thompson, a 25 year old, newly single, unemployed New Yorker. She spends most of her days and nights perusing the classifieds on Craigslist. If you've ever spent time on Craigslist, you can begin to formulate an idea of the disastrous situations Emily finds herself in. It's funny, smart and filled with tons and tons of crazy drama.""My home page used to be Google, but the Craigslist tab was always open, so I recently changed it to Craigslist because it has to be. My entire life revolves around this site, and now that I'm all alone, I need it more than ever.""What is Emily searching for exactly? Well, beyond the happiness we're all searching for, she's looking for a new love interest, a roommate and of course a J-O-B. Unfortunately, she doesn't have the best luck in any of those departments. After scouring ads, she winds up working for some very shady people and dating men that would make most of us turn and run.""What scares me is we never know the truth about the people we meet, date, dream about, worship, or even live with. People are like icebergs. Whenever we look at each other there are huge, hidden parts lurking below the surface. And we never know what they might be.""Just when you think things couldn't get worse they do. The thing is...the bad times never last. Eventually, just like with everything in life, things have to start looking up.I laughed, smiled and rolled my eyes more during this book than I have in a long time. Alexandra Ares brings to life a strong, sassy, fearless young woman. Emily is a girl after my own heart!

2977,2977,"I am glad this was a short read. The intrigue in the story was good enough for me to keep reading, but there were definitely some problems. There were too many spelling errors to count. The writer jumped from writing in past tense to writing in present tense. The dialogue was rather childish.There were errors in some of the content. A man would not spend time and money to build a house then not bother at all to furnish it properly. He would not have thrown a grenade at the door and given the attackers better access to the inside. The story jumps from them investigating to the house being attacked to the FBI taking over the investigation. The FBI would not decide that the characters are to play dead after Josh shoots up the getaway vehicle. A person as adept with firearms as Dana would not have to be told to put a bullet into the chamber of the gun. A man who is trained to fight will not volunteer his qualifications just to scare someone off.As for the romance aspect of it, the writer does absolutely nothing to build up the romance. They act as friends and investigate together. When they have been put in hiding, he just ups and tells her that he likes her and she says that she likes him back, as if they were in high school.This is a decent effort, but the writer has a ways to go before being good.",1,0,0.530075188,0.469924812,NC
2978,2978,"I had not read the author's comments until after reading the book. Happy to see that he confirms my conclusion that it was a series of short stories loosely linked together. The potential reader should understand that there is a reason for the lack of tight plotting. You may or may not find the loose structure acceptable.The author did set out to recreate the style dominant three score years ago. He does a pretty good job of it. Like the attempt of contemporary jazz musicians trying to play in the style of Louis Armstrong's Hot Five or Hot Seven, his professional competence allows for a replica but without the authenticity of the original. Primarily, I would guess, this is due to the fact that, to the original creators, what they wrote (or played) was deeply felt, something new which came from them and their sense of expressing a particular mood, current, sense of being, of their own time; today, what they play is a reproduction of something whose fundamental roots no longer exist.I found the book interesting, though never quite real, always a bit forced to fit the older model. How younger readers might take to it, I cannot know. However, if you have tried and like Mike Hammer, you are likely to find Dark Quarrel a good start for what should be better, more tightly written, later books in the series.",1,1,0.621212121,0.6794871790000001,NC

She is prideful, beautiful, stubborn and head over heels in love with Christos Constantine. He is everything she wants but she won't admit to needing and wanting. Christos is a tall, dark and handsome DOMINANT he has wanted Juliet for years this time he won't stop at no and not having her.This is a story about dominance and submission but not full out BDSM, this is more the emotional aspect of letting go. We see in our heroine a woman who has to always be in control but yearns to let go. Juliet has no idea how to let go to just feel and not be in control of everything she scared to even try. I found myself wanting to yell at Juliet because she just didn't see nor wouldn't see how wonderful her life would be if she just let it go. I wanted her to lean on Christos and he to lean on her to love and laugh and be happy, I found I was Christos' biggest cheerleader and my goodness the man is sexy.When Juliet finally begins to surrender it's almost magical yet their coming together is primal and so high charged. I recommend getting a fan, a cool drink of water and your very own Christos to call your own. I loved this story I loved the emotions and the give and take, I loved meeting Christos' family and seeing him so tender.

2991,2991,"""The Salisury Key"" by Harper Fox is a pretty good gay love story, as these go. It moved along rapidly and was easy reading. The visualization of events, countryside, people and intimacy was first rate.The problems I've noticed with all her gay-themed novels are a) all the main characters are psychologically damaged in some way or other, yet they miraculously recover quickly; b) the sex scenes are always too breathless, intense and ""over the top"" to hold credibility; c) there's way, way, way too much angst on the part of all the major characters; d) each story has a strong mystery-to-solve element; and e) there is always a meticulously worked out ""happy ending"" for the main lover-boys. Not quite sappy most of the time, but borderline.Harper does have a wide range and tackles some rather interesting projects for her characters. Here she includes a fair dose of science, archeology, and mystery.In ""Salisbury"" we have Daniel and Rayne whose frenetic lives populate the pages of this book. I vastly preferred Rayne to Daniel. An interesting twist here is that Fox daringly at the beginning shows a long-term relationship between an older man and a much younger (30 years) man. I did kind of react in shock when Daniel finds it possible to have sex with someone new, a couple days after his partner dies!  Hmmmm.The minor characters are quite minor and less well developed, almost silly sometimes. Working out all the details of the complicated plot requires some tip-toeing through the tulips for the author, but she manages to tie up all the loose ends without the poor reader having to suspend disbelief too often. It's a quick read, not anywhere close to being ""literature,"" but, hey, it's a decent gay love story.  Wonder if she'll ever write about people who are kind of normal, though.I give it a 3.55, rounded up to a 4 for ira sheer 2night entertainment value and appreciation of a readable gay love story that does not solely focus on sex (though there is an abundance of it here).",1,1,0.639303483,0.819651742,LA

He's a great writer.",1,1,0.658823529,0.7725490190000001,LA
